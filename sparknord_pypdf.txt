Question: Quel est le plan de transition pour l'atténuation du changement climatique ? Pour répondre à cette question, nous souhaitons avoir une description brève des principaux leviers de décarbonation, du plan d'investissement et de financement du plan de transition, et de la comptabilité avec un scénario 1,5°C ou 2°C.


Context: Parmi les informations que nous recherchons, nous pouvons lister les éléments suivants : <br><br>Plan de transition est aligné avec un scénario 1,5°C. <br><br>Leviers de décarbonation programmés. <br><br>Plan d'investissement et de financement des leviers de décarbonation. <br><br>Alignement de la stratégie et le plan de financement. <br><br>Suivi des progrès.


Answer: Le plan de transition pour l'atténuation du changement climatique de Spar Nord repose sur plusieurs principaux leviers de décarbonation. Tout d'abord, la banque vise à canaliser ses financements et investissements vers des technologies à faible émission de carbone et des modèles commerciaux soutenant le climat. Cela inclut notamment le soutien à de nouvelles technologies à faible émission de carbone et à des modèles commerciaux qui soutiennent le climat.

En termes d'investissement et de financement, Spar Nord a mis en place un objectif d'ici 2030 de prêter un minimum de 10 milliards de DKK pour des actifs liés à des catégories de prêts incluses dans le cadre de l'obligation verte de la banque. En 2024, la banque a émis des obligations vertes pour un montant de 1,9 milliard de DKK et a identifié une plus grande proportion d'actifs verts dans ses portefeuilles de prêts.

Concernant la comptabilité avec un scénario 1,5°C ou 2°C, Spar Nord s'est fixé une ambition climatique de parvenir à une neutralité carbone d'ici 2050, en accord avec l'objectif de l'Accord de Paris de limiter le réchauffement climatique à 2°C au-dessus des niveaux préindustriels, avec une ambition supplémentaire d'atteindre 1,5°C. La banque a aligné ses cibles de réduction des émissions financées sur des scénarios de neutralité carbone basés sur la science du Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'évolution du climat (GIEC), ce qui a conduit à un ajustement de son objectif de réduction des émissions de son portefeuille de prêts à 50% d'ici 2030.

ously identified Sustainable Development Goal 13,
Climate Action and climate change as the Bank’s
most important impact area, as the Bank is as-
sessed to have bot h positive and negative impacts
on climate change. It was also on the basis of the
analyses from the work on the UN Principles for
Responsible Banking that the Bank’s core activi-
ties were first identified as an important area of
action in relation to clima te change. This recogni-
tion and conclusions from the analysis have been adopted in Spar Nord’s double materiality assess-
ment, where the Bank has performed a screening
of assets and activities related to climate change
as well as a mapping to identify where  in the
value chain the IROs materialise.
The table shows the significant IROs identified in
relation to climate change and the related sus-

In 2024, Spar Nord prepared a climate plan, which
is the Bank’s version of the transition plan for cli-

of Directors of the Bank.
Spar Nord’s Climate Plan sets out the Bank’s cli-

warming to 2°C above pre -industrial levels, with a
further ambition to achieve 1.5°C. Spar Nord under-

Spar Nord’s Climate Plan sets out the Bank’s cli-
mate ambition of reaching net zero by 2050 in line
with the Paris Agreement target of limiting global
warming to 2°C above pre -industrial levels, with a
further ambition to achieve 1.5°C. Spar Nord under-
stands that a responsible transition to net zero
will require us, as a financial institution, to ensure
on the one hand continued access to essential
goods and services, while on the other hand focus-
ing on transitioning key GHG -emitting sectors to
low-emission or zero -emission technologies. This
transformation of society will require significant
investment and financing of technological solu-
tions and climate -supporting business models –
and this is precisely where we as a financial insti-tution must pla y an important role.
Spar Nord has chosen to target the Bank’s climate
ambition towards efforts that contribute to cli-mate change mitigation, as we believe that it is
through decarbonisation of our customers’ assets
and activities that we can deliver the greatest
positive impa ct. Decarbonisation occurs when we
channel finance and investments in a more sus-
tainable direction, e.g. by supporting new low -car-
bon technologies or new climate -supporting busi-
ness models.
Spar Nord is aware that so -called double count-
ing can occur when we as a financial institution
calculate the Bank's GHG emissions. Double count-
ing can be particularly relevant in cases where
both we and our customers assume net zero tar-
gets and thus choose  to compensate for the GHG
emissions that cannot be reduced. In such cases, it may happen that both we and our customers com-
pensate for the same GHG emissions, which will
lead to potential double compensation. However, this does not change the fact that Sp ar Nord con-
siders its climate ambition and targets to be sig-
nificant and important, as we, as a financial insti-
tution, play a central role in driving financing and

climate ambition therefore also relates to an am-
bition to continuously improve our reporting and
increase the transparency of our climate targets
and actions to ensure that emission reductions re-flect actual progress.
Spar Nord is aware of that science and legislation in the sustainability area are constantly evolving, which is why we maintain a fact -based approach
in our climate change mitigation efforts. We do this by focusing on research and analysis, working
proacti vely to improve data quality, and continu-
ously reviewing our goals, actions, and priorities.
Policies
Spar Nord has prepared a number of policies and
guidelines to support the management of activi-
ties in relation to climate change adaptation and mitigation. The most important policies are:
• Sustainability and social responsibility policy
• Environmental and climate policy
• Responsible investment policy
• Credit policy
• Exclusion lists for both financing and invest-
ment  
Spar Nord’s sustainability and social responsibil-
ity policy outlines the Bank’s initiatives to adapt
and mitigate climate change and thus constitutes the overall guideline for managing IROs in the
area of sustainability.
Spar Nord’s responsible investment policy, credit policy, exclusion lists for financing and investment
and the Bank’s climate plan combine to support
climate change mitigation actions and measures
and the management of identified material IROs.

		 Source:By consistently focusing on channelling the Bank’s
financing towards these four categories, the Bank
may contribute to climate change mitigation and to driving progress on climate targets.
Spar Nord has set a target that by 2030 we will
have a minimum of DKK 10 billion lent for assets that can be linked to the loan categories included
in the Bank's Green Bond Framework. In 2024, Spar
Nord issued green bonds for DKK 1.9 billion and
identified a larger proportio n of green assets in
the Bank’s loan portfolios. The Bank is continu-ously working on the development of new products related to the categories in the green framework
and on improving data quality and processes for
registration and identification of green a ssets in
order to support the target.
Energy -enhancing and energy -efficient measures
In order to address the Bank’s negative impact
through consumption of both fossil and renewable
energy sources, and to achieve the climate objec-
tives within scope 1 and 2, the Bank will continu-ously take the following actions:
• By 2030, 80% of the Bank's driving needs will be covered by electric cars. By 2030, all newly
purchased company cars will be exclusively
electric cars.
• Towards 2030, the Bank will phase out the
three remaining natural gas plants.
• From 2023 and ten year onwards, Spar Nord’s
consumption of electricity will be from 100% re-newable energy sources supplied by Better En-
ergy and supplemented by own production
from solar panels.

nanced emissions from lending activities by align-
ing them with climate science -based net -zero sce-

The positive development in 2024 was driven,
among other things, by a general increase in loans
for electric cars, which involve lower emissions
than loans for conventional cars, and an increase

Question: Les objectifs de réduction fixés sont-ils alignés avec une trajectoire de 1,5°C conformément aux Accords de Paris ? L'entreprise mentionne-t-elle une trajectoire conforme aux objectifs SBTi ? Il convient également de noter que, si l'entreprise affiche des objectifs de neutralité carbone, cette neutralité doit nécessairement être alignée avec les recommandations de l'Accord de Paris.


Context: Pour garantir la compatibilité avec un scénario de transition conforme à l'accord de Paris, l'entreprise doit fournir les informations suivantes : <br><br>- Un/des objectif(s) de réduction avec une trajectoire de réchauffement à 1,5°C grâce à une trajectoire de décarbonation sectorielle si disponible, soit grâce à une trajectoire d'émissions transsectorielle compatible avec la limitation de réchauffement de la planète à 1,5°C (cf. AR 26 et 27). <br><br>- Les facteurs de réduction des émissions évoluent et ne sont pas fixes encore. Par conséquent, les entreprises sont encouragées à n'utiliser que des informations actualisées et publiquement accessibles. L'EFRAG préconise Pathways to Net-Zero - SBTi Technical Summary). Les cibles de réduction doivent être fixées respectivement à 2030 et 2050, avec des échellons tous les 5 ans. 


Answer: L'entreprise, Spar Nord, mentionne son ambition climatique d'atteindre la neutralité carbone d'ici 2050, en ligne avec l'objectif de l'Accord de Paris de limiter le réchauffement climatique à 2°C au-dessus des niveaux préindustriels, avec une ambition supplémentaire d'atteindre 1,5°C. Cependant, le texte ne mentionne pas explicitement si les objectifs sont alignés avec les objectifs SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative). Il est important de noter que pour que les objectifs de neutralité carbone soient conformes aux recommandations de l'Accord de Paris, ils doivent être basés sur des scénarios scientifiques, ce qui est indiqué par Spar Nord, mais l'alignement spécifique avec SBTi n'est pas explicitement précisé dans le texte fourni.

		 Source:Target for reducing financed emissions (tCO2e
per DKK million) from asset management  
In 2024, financed emissions from investments in
equities and corporate bonds in asset manage-ment, including investments in the asset classes
through unit trust certificates, were reduced by
48% compared to the 2020 baseline. In 2024, fi-nanced emissions thus amounted to 5.9 tCO2e per
DKK million.
The positive developments in 2024 were attributa-ble in particular to lower financed emissions from
investments in corporate bonds, which related both to conversion to more climate- friendly unit
trust certificates and a reduction in emissions from
existing unit trust certificates.
The reduction means that the Bank has met the
sub- target for 2025 and is well on its way to-
wards meeting the 2030 target.
Targets for decarbonisation of own operations
Spar Nord is focused on mitigating the environ-
mental and climate impact of the Bank’s own ac-
tivities, for example by proactively promoting en-vironmental responsibility and sustainable tech-
nologies in relevant areas of its operations. To
support Spar Nord’s  aspirations of net zero by
2050, the Bank has set a goal of reducing scope 1
and 2 GHG emissions by 30% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 compared to the 2021 baseline of 681 tCO2e.
GHG emission reduction target (tCO2e) from
scope 1 and 2  
In 2024, GHG emissions from scope 1 and 2 totalled 597 tCO2e, representing a reduction of 12% com-
pared to the 2021 baseline.
With this reduction, the Bank follows the projec-tion for the IPCC reduction pathway, but is still
above the projection towards own targets for 2025 and 2030. The Bank is focused on energy -enhancing and energy- efficient measures for
working towards the targets.
Furthermore, the Bank has set a target of reducing
scope 3 GHG emissions from own operations by
25% by 2030 compared to the 2021 baseline of 24,748 tCO2e. Spar Nord has opted to substanti-
ate its targets based on the IPCC reduction path-way.

71 Spar Nord Annual Report 2024  Targets
To support the realisation of Spar Nord’s climate
ambition of net zero by 2050, we have defined a
number of 2030 sub -targets for decarbonisation of
loan and investment activities and for the Bank’s
own operations. Additionally, Spar Nord has set
sub-target s for selected segments, accompanied
by specific actions and metrics, all designed to
support the Bank's strategic direction.
The reduction targets and sub -targets defined by
the Bank are based on baseline analyses of the
Bank’s climate footprint through scope 1, 2 and 3.
As the Bank’s climate change initiatives are an on-
going process, the baseline years are not identical
across the three impact areas. However, the 2050
ambition is shared across the entire business, just
as all activities have been assigned sub -targets
for decarbonisation by 2030. Spar Nord’s targets have been substantiated using scientific scenarios,
which are de scribed in more detail under the spe-
cific activity.
The reduction targets for financed emissions from the Bank’s core activities of loans and investments
relate to significant shares of the Bank’s business volume for bank and leasing loans and invest-
ments in equities and corporate bonds in the
Bank’s asset management.
The reduction targets related to the Bank’s core activities are calculated in the relative metric
tCO2e per DKK million, while the reduction targets
for own operations are calculated in absolute
emissions in the tCO2e metric.
The illustration gives an overview of the Bank’s cli-
mate -related targets. For each target, the base-
line years and the sub -targets set for 2025 and
2030 are presented. The target achievement by
the end of 2024 illustrates progress relative to the
Bank’s 203 0 targets measured on the basis of the
relevant baseline year.

ate its targets based on the IPCC reduction path-way.
GHG emission reduction target (tCO2e) from
scope 3 for own operations  
In 2024, scope 3 GHG emissions from own opera-tions totalled 24,537 tCO2e, which, after a couple
of years of falling numbers, is on a level with the 2021 baseline.
The increase in 2024 was due to higher operating
expenses because GHG emissions for the Bank’s own operations are mainly calculated on the ba-
sis of the monetary principle. It is generally Spar
Nord’s ambition to regularly increase the propor-tion of emissio ns calculated on the basis of pri-
mary data in order to develop measures that will
lead to a reduction of GHG emissions.  Energy consumption
The Bank’s energy consumption amounted to 9,089 MWh in 2024 and is calculated on the basis
of consumption of electricity, district heating, pet-
rol, diesel and gas. Energy consumption is com-
posed of energy from renewable and fossil
sources. In 2024, 80% of energy consumption was from renewable sources, while the remaining 20%
was from fossil sources. Spar Nord remains fo-
cused on energy optimisation and on implement-
ing energy -saving initiatives.

To support the realisation of Spar Nord’s climate
ambition of net zero by 2050, we have defined a
number of 2030 sub -targets for decarbonisation of
loan and investment activities and for the Bank’s
own operations. Additionally, Spar Nord has set
sub-target s for selected segments, accompanied
by specific actions and metrics, all designed to
support the Bank's strategic direction.
The reduction targets and sub -targets defined by
the Bank are based on baseline analyses of the
Bank’s climate footprint through scope 1, 2 and 3.
As the Bank’s climate change initiatives are an on-
going process, the baseline years are not identical
across the three impact areas. However, the 2050
ambition is shared across the entire business, just
as all activities have been assigned sub -targets
for decarbonisation by 2030. Spar Nord’s targets have been substantiated using scientific scenarios,
which are de scribed in more detail under the spe-
cific activity.
The reduction targets for financed emissions from the Bank’s core activities of loans and investments
relate to significant shares of the Bank’s business volume for bank and leasing loans and invest-
ments in equities and corporate bonds in the
Bank’s asset management.
The reduction targets related to the Bank’s core activities are calculated in the relative metric
tCO2e per DKK million, while the reduction targets
for own operations are calculated in absolute
emissions in the tCO2e metric.
The illustration gives an overview of the Bank’s cli-
mate -related targets. For each target, the base-
line years and the sub -targets set for 2025 and
2030 are presented. The target achievement by
the end of 2024 illustrates progress relative to the
Bank’s 203 0 targets measured on the basis of the
relevant baseline year.

		 Source:Target for reducing financed emissions (tCO2e
per DKK million) from asset management  
In 2024, financed emissions from investments in
equities and corporate bonds in asset manage-ment, including investments in the asset classes
through unit trust certificates, were reduced by
48% compared to the 2020 baseline. In 2024, fi-nanced emissions thus amounted to 5.9 tCO2e per
DKK million.
The positive developments in 2024 were attributa-ble in particular to lower financed emissions from
investments in corporate bonds, which related both to conversion to more climate- friendly unit
trust certificates and a reduction in emissions from
existing unit trust certificates.
The reduction means that the Bank has met the
sub- target for 2025 and is well on its way to-
wards meeting the 2030 target.
Targets for decarbonisation of own operations
Spar Nord is focused on mitigating the environ-
mental and climate impact of the Bank’s own ac-
tivities, for example by proactively promoting en-vironmental responsibility and sustainable tech-
nologies in relevant areas of its operations. To
support Spar Nord’s  aspirations of net zero by
2050, the Bank has set a goal of reducing scope 1
and 2 GHG emissions by 30% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 compared to the 2021 baseline of 681 tCO2e.
GHG emission reduction target (tCO2e) from
scope 1 and 2  
In 2024, GHG emissions from scope 1 and 2 totalled 597 tCO2e, representing a reduction of 12% com-
pared to the 2021 baseline.
With this reduction, the Bank follows the projec-tion for the IPCC reduction pathway, but is still
above the projection towards own targets for 2025 and 2030. The Bank is focused on energy -enhancing and energy- efficient measures for
working towards the targets.
Furthermore, the Bank has set a target of reducing
scope 3 GHG emissions from own operations by
25% by 2030 compared to the 2021 baseline of 24,748 tCO2e. Spar Nord has opted to substanti-
ate its targets based on the IPCC reduction path-way.

		 Source:Spar Nord’s current positive achievement of tar-
gets is attributed to Denmark generally having
come relatively far in the process of electrifying
the car fleet. In 2024, sales of electric cars in Denmark were record high, and as this was also
reflected among Spar Nord’s customers, the Bank
recorded an increase in loans for electric cars. This
development is also supported by the fact that
the Bank offers customers a particularly attrac-
tive financin g of electric cars through dedicated
credit and loan products .
Home loans to retail customers
Spar Nord has defined a sub -target of reducing fi-
nanced emissions from housing by 70% with a
2030 baseline of 11.4 kgCO2e/m2 per year.
The Bank uses the net -zero scenario from Carbon
Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM), which provides
a net -zero reduction pathway at national level as
well as for different property types. The CRREM
uses GHG emissions per m2 per year as a metric.
Target for the reducing financed emissions
(kgCO2e/m2 per year) from home loans  
As can be seen from the chart, emissions per m2 of loans to private homes in 2024 were on a par with
the baseline year 2023. Spar Nord expects that, in the coming years, we will look into a reduction in
GHG emissions per m2 in line with the phasing -in of
green energy and the increasing focus on energy improvement of the housing stock.  Corporate loans to the transport sector
Spar Nord has defined a sub -target of reducing fi-
nanced emissions from loans to the transport sec-
tor by 30% by 2030 relative to a 2023 baseline of
40.7 tCO2e per DKK million. The target has been
substantiated on the basis of KF24.
Target for reducing financed emissions (tCO2e
per DKK million) for the transport sector  
In 2024, financed emissions from the transport sec-tor amounted to 34.5 tCO2e per DKK million, rep-
resenting a reduction of 15% compared to the 2023 baseline year. In other words, the Bank is well on
its way towards meeting the 2030 target.

72 Spar Nord Annual Report 2024  Loan decarbonisation targets
To support Spar Nord’s net zero target, in 2022 the
Bank defined two sub -targets for the reduction of
financed emissions from lending activities to retail
and business customers by 20% in 2025 and 45%
in 2030, respectively, relative to a 2021 baseline of 8.8 tCO2e per DKK million. In 2024, Spar Nord de-
cided to substantiate and refine its climate ambi-
tion and the supporting reduction targets for fi-
nanced emissions from lending activities by align-
ing them with climate science -based net -zero sce-
narios from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change (IPCC). This substantiation led to an
adjustment of the sub -target for the overall loan
portfolio from the previous reduction target of 45% to now 50% by 2030.
Targets for reducing financed emissions (tCO2e
per DKK million) from the overall loan portfolio  
In 2024, financed emissions from the loan portfolio were reduced by 40% compared to the 2021 base-
line. In 2024, financed emissions from the overall loan portfolio amounted to 5.3 tCO2e per DKK mil-
lion.
The positive development in 2024 was driven,
among other things, by a general increase in loans
for electric cars, which involve lower emissions
than loans for conventional cars, and an increase

Question: Quelles sont les mesures prises pour remédier au non-respect des procédures et des normes en matière de lutte contre la corruption? Pour répondre à cette question, s'intéresser aux mesures de détection, aux mesures de remédiation et à l'engagement continu en matière de lutte anti-corruption.


Context: 24(b) Toute mesure prise pour remédier au non-respect des procédures et des normes en matière de lutte contre la corruption.


Answer: Spar Nord a mis en place plusieurs mesures pour remédier au non-respect des procédures et des normes en matière de lutte contre la corruption. Ces mesures incluent :

1. **Mesures de détection :** 
   - La banque effectue des vérifications accrues sur les employés exposés, notamment ceux du département AML (anti-blanchiment d'argent), les personnes clés et les membres du conseil exécutif, en obtenant notamment des extraits de casier judiciaire sur une base annuelle.
   - Les comptes des employés, y compris ceux du conseil d'administration et du conseil exécutif, sont surveillés pour détecter toute activité suspecte.
   - Spar Nord procède au filtrage des employés pour déterminer s'ils sont, ou ont été, liés à une personne politiquement exposée.

2. **Mesures de remédiation :**
   - En cas de réponse insatisfaisante ou de détection de non-conformité, il y a une enquête interne menée par l'unité de lanceurs d'alerte de Spar Nord, qui fait partie du département de conformité de la banque.

3. **Engagement continu :**
   - La banque a une politique de tolérance zéro envers la corruption et la subornation, qui est communiquée à tous les employés à travers des formations obligatoires sur la lutte contre la corruption et la subornation.
   - Des mesures préventives sont mises en œuvre pour réduire les risques associés aux cadeaux, aux dons, aux conflits d'intérêts, aux fournisseurs tiers et aux risques de transactions liées aux clients.
   - Spar Nord a développé une politique anti-corruption et subornation qui décrit les attentes de la direction envers les employés de la banque.
   - Tous les employés et clients passent en revue les obligations en vertu des réglementations anti-blanchiment d'argent, et il y a une formation continue pour sensibiliser et équiper les employés face à la corruption et à la subornation.

Ces mesures visent à maintenir un haut niveau d'intégrité personnelle et organisationnelle et à minimiser les risques de corruption et de subornation.

ternal investigation is generally carried out by
Spar Nord’s whistle blower unit, which is part of
the Bank’s compliance department.
In connection with the whistleblower scheme, the
Bank has developed a whistleblower policy, which
sets out the Bank’s handling of the whistleblower
scheme and a personal data policy for the whis-
tleblower scheme, which describes the Bank’s pro-
cessing of per sonal data in the whistleblower
scheme.
Suppliers
In 2024, Spar Nord’s purchases of goods and ser-vices totalled DKK 1,380 million from more than
2,500 Danish and foreign suppliers. Purchases from
the 100 largest suppliers accounted for 84% of to-
tal purchases.
Spar Nord prioritises maintaining good and trans-
parent supplier relationships that underpin the
Bank’s good reputation and help attract and retain good suppliers and customers. Spar Nord re-quires that the Bank’s suppliers support interna-
tionally recognised principles for human rights,
the International Labour Organization labour
market conventions on the dignity of workers, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the ten general principles described in the UN
Global Compact. Spar Nord has prepar ed a code
of conduct for suppliers, and all of the Bank’s pri-
mary suppliers automatically accede to this when
they either establish or renew supplier agreements with the Bank.
In 2024, Spar Nord selected 25 suppliers and
asked them in a questionnaire to consider the spe-cific circumstances in their own supply chain and
production. Their responses were generally satis-
factory, and only very few gave rise to further
scrutiny and dia logue.
Anti -corruption and bribery
At Spar Nord, we have a zero tolerance policy to-
wards corruption and bribery. This applies both in-
ternally at Spar Nord and in cooperation with our
customers and external partners. In general, Spar
Nord estimates that all employees are exposed to

Anti -corruption and bribery
At Spar Nord, we have a zero tolerance policy to-
wards corruption and bribery. This applies both in-
ternally at Spar Nord and in cooperation with our
customers and external partners. In general, Spar
Nord estimates that all employees are exposed to
corruptio n and bribery. However, employees in the
AML department, key persons and the members of
the Bank’s Executive Board are particularly ex-
posed, which is why the Bank carries out increased
checks on these persons, which, among other
things, involves obtaining criminal records on an
annual basis according to the Danish AML Act.
In order for the Bank to maintain the highest
standard of personal and organisational integrity
and prudence and to minimise risks, it is important
that Spar Nord’s employees are familiar with the
conduct and work ethics expected of them. There-
fore, Spar N ord has developed an anti -corruption
and bribery policy describing the expectations
management has of the Bank’s employees. The

Bank’s internal staff handbook, which elaborates
on how employees should act in connection with potential conflicts of interest, receipt and giving of
gifts, entertainment, invitations, business part-ners, close  relations, etc.
To increase employee awareness and equip them
as well as possible in relation to corruption and bribery, all employees and all customers go
through the obligations under the money launder-
ing regulations. Employees also receive manda-tory training in anti -corruption and bribery to ex-
emplify where they need to show increased atten-
tion.

emplify where they need to show increased atten-
tion.
To reduce the risk of the Bank’s employees, cus-
tomers, or partners being exposed to or engaging in corruption and bribery, the Bank has imple-
mented a range of preventive measures and es-
tablished a control environment designed to miti-gate corruption and bribery associated with vari-
ous elements, such as gifts, donations, conflicts of
interest, third -party providers, and customer -re-
lated transaction risks. In addition, the Bank’s em-
ployees, including the Board of Directors and Exec-
utive Board, and other management layers, are screened to determine whether they are, or have
been, related to a politically exposed person. Fur-
thermore, monitoring of employees’ accounts is
conducted.
At the end of 2024, the Bank has not received any
convictions or fines related to corruption and brib-
ery, nor has there been any incidents in this re-
gard, which is also stated in the memo on Man-agement statement on fraud, which is discussed
annually by the  Board of Directors.  Political influence and lobbying
activities
In line with its corporate social responsibility and
local commitment, the Bank continuously provides
financial contributions and sponsorships to a wide range of causes and organisations in the towns
and areas where we operate. Spar Nord is a mem-
ber of the industry communities National Banks in
Denmark and Finance Denmark, both of which aim
to promote the interests of banks in the public de-
bate and to increase knowledge and confidence in the financial sector in general. None of Spar
Nord’s sponsorships or m emberships are moti-

The Executive Board reports annually to the Board
of Directors on implementation and compliance
with the policy on sound corporate culture. The re-
port is used for discussion at the Bank’s annual
general meeting, where the Chairman of the Board
is required to report on the implementation and compliance with the policy on sound corporate
culture.
Whistleblower scheme
As part of Spar Nord’s principles for a sound cor-
porate culture, the Bank wishes to promote a safe
and open communication culture where employees
can always feel secure in approaching the highest
level of management.  In order to support a culture of openness and trust, the Bank has a whistleblower scheme that can be
used to report violations or potential violations of
financial legislation and other serious matters, in-
cluding suspicion or knowledge of illegal, unethi-
cal or irregular conduct concerning Spar Nord.
The Bank’s whistleblower scheme can be used
both internally by Spar Nord’s employees and ex-ternally by suppliers, business partners and other
stakeholders. The whistleblower scheme is availa-
ble 24/7, and reports can be submitted in writing via Spar Nord’s whistleblower portal, which can
be accessed on Spar Nord’s intranet or the website sparnord.dk.
Our whistleblower scheme is anonymous and inde-
pendent, and it is managed by a third party,
which enables the Bank to protect the person re-
porting the concern from reprisals. The further in-
ternal investigation is generally carried out by
Spar Nord’s whistle blower unit, which is part of
the Bank’s compliance department.
In connection with the whistleblower scheme, the
Bank has developed a whistleblower policy, which
sets out the Bank’s handling of the whistleblower
scheme and a personal data policy for the whis-
tleblower scheme, which describes the Bank’s pro-
cessing of per sonal data in the whistleblower
scheme.

Question: Quelles sont les émissions totales du Scope 2, calculées grâce à la méthode "location-based" ?


Context: nan


Answer: Les émissions totales du Scope 2, calculées grâce à la méthode "location-based", sont de 784 tCO2e pour l'année 2024.


Sources:


		 Source:• Emission data from Capital Market Partners
• Emission data from Danmarks Skibskredit A/S  
Scope 1
Owned and leased vehicles
Emissions associated with diesel and petrol con-
sumption in owned and leased vehicles. The cate-gory covers the Bank’s cars, including loan cars
and company cars. Emissions from cars are calcu-
lated on the basis of the amount of petrol and die-sel fuel used. F or company cars, all mileage is ac-
counted for in this category, with no distinction
made between business and private use.
The emission factor for Kg CO2e/litre fuel is based
on the Danish Energy Agency and DEFRA. Data are
collected in litres of fuel.
Consumption of gas
Emissions associated with natural gas consump-
tion for heating buildings.
The emission factor for Kg CO2e/m3 is based on energy statistics from the Danish Energy Agency
and DEFRA. Data is read in m3.
Direct GHG emissions from refrigerants
The category includes direct fugitive emissions re-
lated to GHG emissions from the company’s refrig-
eration systems due to refrigerant leaks. Consumption data is based on estimates from the
service provider regarding annual refill require-ments.
Emission factors for kg CO2e/kg are based on the
IPCC Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change, Chapter 7. Data
are calculated in kilogrammes.
Scope 2
Electricity
Full-year consumption data are obtained in kWh
directly from the utility company’s customer por-tal at meter level. Emissions are calculated under
the two methods in the GHG Protocol: market -
based and location- based. The market -based cal-
culation is based on the electricity declaration is-
sued by Energinet. In the calculation of emissions
using the location -based method, the Bank uses
the environmental declaration issued by Ener-
ginet, specified by Western and Eastern Denmark.
District heating
Full-year consumption data are obtained in kWh
directly from the utility company’s customer por-

District heating
Full-year consumption data are obtained in kWh
directly from the utility company’s customer por-
tal at meter level for locations with own meters. It
is not possible to state the consumption at loca-
tions where district heating is paid on account
with rent as  this is not published by the landlord.

relevance of each of the 15 scope 3 categories and
pertaining data sources.

1. Goods and services  Emissions associated with the extraction, production and
transportation of goods and services purchased or acquired by
the reporting company in the reporting year.  The category is considered relevant in view of the
extent of the Bank’s purchases.  The calculated emissions are mainly based on the monetary principle based on the operating costs for the year. Data
processing is performed at the account level.  
In some places, the monetary principle has been replaced by emission data from the supplier.  Much of Spar Nord’s
scope 3 is indirect GHG emissions from the data processing centre BEC Financial Technologies that provides advice,
technology and operational services to Spar Nord. Spar Nord calculates emissions related to BEC based on the
supplier’s  emission data and uses the Bank’s share of BEC as key for BEC’s scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Emission factors for the calculation have been obtained from the Exiobase database.
6. Business travel  Emissions from the transportation of employees for business -
related activities during the reporting year in vehicles not
owned or operated by the reporting company.  The category is considered relevant.  Employee air travel is primarily based on CO2e calculations provided by travel agencies. In the calculation of
emissions, a distinction is made between domestic and international flights, using relevant emission factors from
DEFRA without RFI.  
Travel in  employees’ private vehicles is based on recorded mileage. Emission factors are based on calculations from
the Danish Centre for Environment and Energy (DCE) on passenger transport by means of transport and DEFRA.
7. Employee commuting  Emissions from the transportation of employees between their

patterns, number of employees in the relevant year, and emissions factors from the Danish Energy Agency and DEFRA.
8. Upstream leased assets  Emissions from the operation of assets leased by the reporting
company in the reporting year and not included in scope 1 and

electricity and district heating are calculated in
scope 2.
The Bank's other indirect GHG emissions relate
both to its own banking operations and in particu-
lar to its core lending and investment activities and are calculated in scope 3.
Indirect GHG emissions from own operations are
particularly related to the purchase of goods and services, as well as business travel and staff com-
muting to and from work.
Indirect GHG emissions from the Bank’s core activi-ties are linked to bank and leasing loans and in-
vestment activities, which include asset manage-ment on behalf of customers and the Bank’s pro-
prietary portfolio.
Spar Nord annually compiles GHG emissions for its own operations and core activities, which together
form the Bank’s climate accounts. The climate ac-counts make it clear that the majority of the
Bank’s total climate footprint is attributable to its
core ac tivities of lending and investments. In 2024,
GHG emissions totalled 787,948 tCO2e, of which
97% related to core activities, while 3% related to own operations.  The GHG intensity based on net income amounted to 139 tCO2e per DKK million in 2024. The calcula-
tion was made using total GHG emissions under the market- based method and core income from
the financial statements consisting of net interest income, net fee i ncome, market value adjustments
and dividends, and other income.
The principles and methods for compiling the Bank’s GHG emissions are described in more detail
in the accounting policies for environmental dis-closures.
Own operations
GHG emissions from own operations were in 2024
calculated at 25,134 tCO2e compared with 22,681
in 2023 (marked -based method), consisting of
scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, of which the vast ma-jority related to indirect scope 3 GHG emissions.
Scope 1 GHG emissions from driving the Bank’s cars
and heating with natural gas amounted to 194
tCO2e in 2024, against 222 in 2023, corresponding to a 13% reduction.

		 Source:against 261,795 in 2023, corresponding to a de-
crease of 2%. The change should be seen in the light of the fact that the calculations for 2024 in-
cluded a tota l business volume of DKK 48.5 billion,
compared to DKK 43.1 billion in 2023, which corre-
sponds to an increase of 13%. The decline in the
Bank's financed absolute emissions can be at-
tributed to an increase in loans for electric cars and bank mortgage loans and reduced emission
factors relating to corporate loans.
In 2024, financed emissions from lending totalled
5.3 tCO2e per DKK million, compared with 6.1 in 2023, which corresponds to a decrease of 13%.  GHG emissions from loans to retail customers amounted to 31,041 tCO2e in 2024, against 33,856
in 2023. There was also a decrease in financed emissions, which in 2024 amounted to 2.0 tCO2e
per DKK million, compared with 2.5 in 2023. The de-
crease was driven by developments in electric car loans and bank mortgage loans, which involve
lower emissions than conventional car loans and home loans.
Corporate loans accounted for the vast majority
of total GHG emissions from lending with 226,688 tCO2e in 2024, compared with 227,939 in 2023. It
was particularly loans to the transport and agri-
cultural sectors that were associated with GHG emissions. In 2 024, the transport sector alone ac-
counted for 37% of Spar Nord’s total GHG emis-sions from corporate loans, while agriculture ac-
counted for 27%.
Financed emissions from lending to business cus-
tomers amounted to 6.9 tCO2e per DKK million in
2024, compared with 7.7 in 2023. Thus, there has
been a decrease of 11%, which can primarily be ex-plained by the fact that the Bank’s lending in-
creased in relati ve terms to the industries real es-
tate, building and construction and trade, which
all involve relatively low emissions. Furthermore,
the emission factors from Statistics Denmark were falling for the industries in general.  Investment

74 Spar Nord Annual Report 2024  GHG emissions
Spar Nord calculates GHG emissions pursuant to
E1 Climate change, which refers to the three
scopes of the GHG Protocol, where a distinction is
made between direct and indirect GHG emissions.
Spar Nord’s direct greenhouse gas emissions are
generated through the Bank’s own operations
from driving the Bank’s cars and heating with nat-ural gas and are calculated in scope 1.
The Bank’s indirect GHG emissions from consumed
electricity and district heating are calculated in
scope 2.
The Bank's other indirect GHG emissions relate
both to its own banking operations and in particu-
lar to its core lending and investment activities and are calculated in scope 3.
Indirect GHG emissions from own operations are
particularly related to the purchase of goods and services, as well as business travel and staff com-
muting to and from work.

____________________

		 Source:in the accounting policies for environmental dis-closures.
Own operations
GHG emissions from own operations were in 2024
calculated at 25,134 tCO2e compared with 22,681
in 2023 (marked -based method), consisting of
scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, of which the vast ma-jority related to indirect scope 3 GHG emissions.
Scope 1 GHG emissions from driving the Bank’s cars
and heating with natural gas amounted to 194
tCO2e in 2024, against 222 in 2023, corresponding to a 13% reduction.
GHG emissions from consumed electricity and dis-
trict heating in scope 2 after the marked -based
method amounted to 403 tCO2e in 2024, against
393 in 2023, or an increase of 2%.
From 2023 and ten year onwards, Spar Nord’s con-sumption of electricity will be from 100% renewa-
ble energy sources supplied by Better Energy and supplemented by own production from solar pan-
els.
In relation to scope 3 GHG emissions, 8 of the 15
scope 3 categories are relevant for Spar Nord for
calculating emissions. Of these, 7 categories con-cern emissions relating to own operations, while
category 15 relates to the Bank’s core activities of
lendi ng and investments. Emissions in categories 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 13, which all relate to the Bank’s
own operations, totalled 24,537 tCO2e in 2024,
against 22,066 in 2023. This 11% increase was pri-marily attributable to category 1 Purchased goods
and services and 2 Capital goods. GHG emissions
for the Bank’s own operations are mainly com-piled on the basis of the monetary principle, and
only 1,642 tCO2e, equal to 6%, were compiled on
the basis of primary data. The development in scope 3 emissions thus widely reflects the increase
in costs in 2024 relative to 2023.The Bank intends to work to increase the propor-tion of emissions calculated on the basis of pri-
mary data in order to make dedicated efforts that
will lead to a reduction of GHG emissions.

		 Source:Target for reducing financed emissions (tCO2e
per DKK million) from asset management  
In 2024, financed emissions from investments in
equities and corporate bonds in asset manage-ment, including investments in the asset classes
through unit trust certificates, were reduced by
48% compared to the 2020 baseline. In 2024, fi-nanced emissions thus amounted to 5.9 tCO2e per
DKK million.
The positive developments in 2024 were attributa-ble in particular to lower financed emissions from
investments in corporate bonds, which related both to conversion to more climate- friendly unit
trust certificates and a reduction in emissions from
existing unit trust certificates.
The reduction means that the Bank has met the
sub- target for 2025 and is well on its way to-
wards meeting the 2030 target.
Targets for decarbonisation of own operations
Spar Nord is focused on mitigating the environ-
mental and climate impact of the Bank’s own ac-
tivities, for example by proactively promoting en-vironmental responsibility and sustainable tech-
nologies in relevant areas of its operations. To
support Spar Nord’s  aspirations of net zero by
2050, the Bank has set a goal of reducing scope 1
and 2 GHG emissions by 30% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 compared to the 2021 baseline of 681 tCO2e.
GHG emission reduction target (tCO2e) from
scope 1 and 2  
In 2024, GHG emissions from scope 1 and 2 totalled 597 tCO2e, representing a reduction of 12% com-
pared to the 2021 baseline.
With this reduction, the Bank follows the projec-tion for the IPCC reduction pathway, but is still
above the projection towards own targets for 2025 and 2030. The Bank is focused on energy -enhancing and energy- efficient measures for
working towards the targets.
Furthermore, the Bank has set a target of reducing
scope 3 GHG emissions from own operations by
25% by 2030 compared to the 2021 baseline of 24,748 tCO2e. Spar Nord has opted to substanti-
ate its targets based on the IPCC reduction path-way.

71 Spar Nord Annual Report 2024  Targets
To support the realisation of Spar Nord’s climate
ambition of net zero by 2050, we have defined a
number of 2030 sub -targets for decarbonisation of
loan and investment activities and for the Bank’s
own operations. Additionally, Spar Nord has set
sub-target s for selected segments, accompanied
by specific actions and metrics, all designed to
support the Bank's strategic direction.
The reduction targets and sub -targets defined by
the Bank are based on baseline analyses of the
Bank’s climate footprint through scope 1, 2 and 3.
As the Bank’s climate change initiatives are an on-
going process, the baseline years are not identical
across the three impact areas. However, the 2050
ambition is shared across the entire business, just
as all activities have been assigned sub -targets
for decarbonisation by 2030. Spar Nord’s targets have been substantiated using scientific scenarios,
which are de scribed in more detail under the spe-
cific activity.
The reduction targets for financed emissions from the Bank’s core activities of loans and investments
relate to significant shares of the Bank’s business volume for bank and leasing loans and invest-
ments in equities and corporate bonds in the
Bank’s asset management.
The reduction targets related to the Bank’s core activities are calculated in the relative metric
tCO2e per DKK million, while the reduction targets
for own operations are calculated in absolute
emissions in the tCO2e metric.
The illustration gives an overview of the Bank’s cli-
mate -related targets. For each target, the base-
line years and the sub -targets set for 2025 and
2030 are presented. The target achievement by
the end of 2024 illustrates progress relative to the
Bank’s 203 0 targets measured on the basis of the
relevant baseline year.

72 Spar Nord Annual Report 2024  Loan decarbonisation targets
To support Spar Nord’s net zero target, in 2022 the
Bank defined two sub -targets for the reduction of
financed emissions from lending activities to retail
and business customers by 20% in 2025 and 45%
in 2030, respectively, relative to a 2021 baseline of 8.8 tCO2e per DKK million. In 2024, Spar Nord de-
cided to substantiate and refine its climate ambi-
tion and the supporting reduction targets for fi-
nanced emissions from lending activities by align-
ing them with climate science -based net -zero sce-
narios from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change (IPCC). This substantiation led to an
adjustment of the sub -target for the overall loan
portfolio from the previous reduction target of 45% to now 50% by 2030.
Targets for reducing financed emissions (tCO2e
per DKK million) from the overall loan portfolio  
In 2024, financed emissions from the loan portfolio were reduced by 40% compared to the 2021 base-
line. In 2024, financed emissions from the overall loan portfolio amounted to 5.3 tCO2e per DKK mil-
lion.
The positive development in 2024 was driven,
among other things, by a general increase in loans
for electric cars, which involve lower emissions
than loans for conventional cars, and an increase

Furthermore, the Bank has set a target of reducing
scope 3 GHG emissions from own operations by
25% by 2030 compared to the 2021 baseline of 24,748 tCO2e. Spar Nord has opted to substanti-
ate its targets based on the IPCC reduction path-way.
GHG emission reduction target (tCO2e) from
scope 3 for own operations  
In 2024, scope 3 GHG emissions from own opera-tions totalled 24,537 tCO2e, which, after a couple
of years of falling numbers, is on a level with the 2021 baseline.
The increase in 2024 was due to higher operating
expenses because GHG emissions for the Bank’s own operations are mainly calculated on the ba-
sis of the monetary principle. It is generally Spar
Nord’s ambition to regularly increase the propor-tion of emissio ns calculated on the basis of pri-
mary data in order to develop measures that will
lead to a reduction of GHG emissions.  Energy consumption
The Bank’s energy consumption amounted to 9,089 MWh in 2024 and is calculated on the basis
of consumption of electricity, district heating, pet-
rol, diesel and gas. Energy consumption is com-
posed of energy from renewable and fossil
sources. In 2024, 80% of energy consumption was from renewable sources, while the remaining 20%
was from fossil sources. Spar Nord remains fo-
cused on energy optimisation and on implement-
ing energy -saving initiatives.

One -third of Spar Nord’s GHG emissions is linked to
the assets we manage on behalf of our customers.
To support Spar Nord’s net zero target, the Bank
has defined a target of reducing financed emis-
sions from investments in equities and corporate bonds in as set management by 30% by 2025 and
60% by 2030, respectively, relative to a 2020 baseline of 11.3 tCO2e per DKK million and based
on scopes 1 and 2 for underlying businesses.
To substantiate its sub -targets, the Bank has ap-
plied the IPCC reduction pathway, which entails a minimum reduction of 48% in GHG emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050 relative to 2019.

Answer: Les émissions de gaz à effet de serre liées à la Catégorie 15 du GHG Protocol, c'est-à-dire les émissions financées, sont considérées comme pertinentes par la banque étudiée. Ces émissions proviennent principalement des activités de prêts et d'investissements de la banque.

1. **Type de financement** :
   - **Prêts** : Les émissions financées liées aux prêts incluent les prêts bancaires et les prêts de leasing. Les activités de leasing comprennent le leasing financier où le preneur acquiert le contrôle de l'actif après l'expiration du bail.
   - **Investissements** : Les émissions financées liées aux investissements incluent le portefeuille de gestion d'actifs de la banque et le portefeuille propriétaire. Les investissements sont calculés en utilisant les données d'émission de MSCI, Capital Market Partners, et Danmarks Skibskredit A/S pour différents types d'actifs tels que les actions, les obligations d'entreprise, les fonds communs de placement, les obligations hypothécaires et les obligations de navire.

2. **Secteurs d'activité** :
   - Les émissions des prêts aux clients professionnels sont calculées sur la base d'une répartition sectorielle du portefeuille de prêts, avec des facteurs d'émission basés sur les données de Statistics Denmark.

3. **Émissions financées du portefeuille d'investissements** :
   - La banque inclut dans son calcul les investissements où elle a l'autorité décisionnelle, y compris les investissements qui ne font pas partie du bilan financier de la banque.

4. **Méthodologie** :
   - Les émissions sont calculées selon le modèle CO2 de Finance Denmark, basé sur les méthodes de PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) et le GHG Protocol. Les émissions financées sont exprimées en termes absolus (tCO2e) et relatifs (tCO2e par million DKK prêté).

En résumé, la banque a inclus la Catégorie 15 dans son inventaire des émissions et utilise des méthodes établies pour calculer les émissions financées provenant de ses prêts et investissements.

13. Downstream leased assets  Emissions from the operation of assets owned by the reporting
company and leased in the reporting year, not included in
scope 1 and scope 2.   The category is considered relevant.  The energy consumption of let properties is estimated on the basis of calculated key energy consumption figures per
square metre area (based on the Bank’s owned square metres) and the number of square metres let in the relevant
year. Emission factors are t he same as those used in calculating scope 1 and 2 and scope 3, category 3.
14. Franchises  Emissions from the operation of franchises in the reporting
year, not included in scope 1 and scope 2.  The category is not considered relevant because
the Bank does not own franchises.
15. Investments  Emissions from investments, including asset management and
proprietary portfolio, as well as loans to retail and business
customers.  The category is considered relevant.  GHG emissions associated with the Bank’s lending and investments are calculated in accordance with Finance
Denmark’s CO2 model.  
Lending
The calculation of financed absolute and relative emissions from lending is based on the Bank’s lending at year -end,
calculated before impairment charges. The calculation only includes loans recognised in the balance sheet and thus
does not include mediated loans where the loans are recognised in the balance sheet of a collaborating bank such as
Totalkredit and DLR Kredi t.
Reverse transactions are not included in the calculation basis. The loan consists of bank loans and leasing loans.
Leasing activities include financial leasing where the lessee acquires control of the asset after the lease expires, and
the related emissio ns are therefore presented together with the Bank’s other loans in category 15.
The calculation of financed absolute and relative emissions from bank and leasing loans to business customers is

		 Source:the two methods in the GHG Protocol: market -
based and location- based. The market -based cal-
culation is based on the electricity declaration is-
sued by Energinet. In the calculation of emissions
using the location -based method, the Bank uses
the environmental declaration issued by Ener-
ginet, specified by Western and Eastern Denmark.
District heating
Full-year consumption data are obtained in kWh
directly from the utility company’s customer por-
tal at meter level for locations with own meters. It
is not possible to state the consumption at loca-
tions where district heating is paid on account
with rent as  this is not published by the landlord.

relevance of each of the 15 scope 3 categories and
pertaining data sources.

1. Goods and services  Emissions associated with the extraction, production and
transportation of goods and services purchased or acquired by
the reporting company in the reporting year.  The category is considered relevant in view of the
extent of the Bank’s purchases.  The calculated emissions are mainly based on the monetary principle based on the operating costs for the year. Data
processing is performed at the account level.  
In some places, the monetary principle has been replaced by emission data from the supplier.  Much of Spar Nord’s
scope 3 is indirect GHG emissions from the data processing centre BEC Financial Technologies that provides advice,
technology and operational services to Spar Nord. Spar Nord calculates emissions related to BEC based on the
supplier’s  emission data and uses the Bank’s share of BEC as key for BEC’s scope 1 and 2 emissions.

		 Source:tocol. The compilation also builds on Finance Denmark’s CO2 model for the financial sector,
which is based on PCAF’s methods and the GHG Protocol.
• Scope 1 covers direct emissions derived from the
Bank’s activities and processes, including fuel
consumption in the Bank’s vehicles and fuel for
heating.
• Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from produc-
tion of the energy consumed by the Bank from
the public utility grid, including electricity and
district heating.
• Scope 3 covers indirect emissions from the up-stream and downstream value chain. GHG
emissions derive from, among other things, ex-
traction of raw materials, transportation and production of the materials, goods and services
consumed by the Bank. Indirect em issions re-
lated to the Bank’s lending and investment are
also included here.  
According to ESRS 1 General requirements, the
compilation of GHG emissions includes the seven
greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, PFC, CF 6
and NF3.
Emission data sources
The following emission data sources have been
used to compile GHG emissions:
Own operations
• DEFRA - UK Government GHG Conversion Fac-
tors for Company Reporting (DEFRA)
• Exoibase
• IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  
Lending
• Emission factors for industries based on data from Statistics Denmark  • Emission factors for vehicles from the Danish
Centre for Environment and Energy, Aarhus University (DCE)
• Emission factors for housing from e -nettet
based on public data sources  
Investment
• Emission data from MSCI
• Emission data from Capital Market Partners
• Emission data from Danmarks Skibskredit A/S  
Scope 1
Owned and leased vehicles
Emissions associated with diesel and petrol con-
sumption in owned and leased vehicles. The cate-gory covers the Bank’s cars, including loan cars
and company cars. Emissions from cars are calcu-
lated on the basis of the amount of petrol and die-sel fuel used. F or company cars, all mileage is ac-
counted for in this category, with no distinction

Reverse transactions are not included in the calculation basis. The loan consists of bank loans and leasing loans.
Leasing activities include financial leasing where the lessee acquires control of the asset after the lease expires, and
the related emissio ns are therefore presented together with the Bank’s other loans in category 15.
The calculation of financed absolute and relative emissions from bank and leasing loans to business customers is
based on an industry breakdown of the loan portfolio, and the e mission factors are based on data from Statistics
Denmark. Emissions from home loans are estimated on the basis of the buildings’ energy performance certificate, and
where there is no such certificate, the estimate is based on other knowledge about the in dividual property. For car
loans to retail customers, WLTP emission factors are used based on the fuel type of the specific vehicle. Emissions cover
scope 1 and 2 emissions.  
Investments
The calculation of financed absolute and relative emissions from inv estments was made on the basis of the Bank’s
investments in Spar Nord’s asset management and proprietary portfolio. Investments where the Bank has the decision -
making authority are included in the calculation. This means the calculation also includes hold ings that are not part
of the Bank’s financial balance sheet, such as Stjerneinvest and individual power of attorney agreements. The
calculation includes investments in equities, corporate bonds, unit trusts, mortgage bonds and ship mortgage bonds.
For eq uities, corporate bonds and unit trusts, emission data from MSCI is used, for mortgage bonds data from Capital
Market Partners is used, and for ship mortgage bonds data from Danmarks Skibskredit A/S is used. The calculation
covers scope 1 and 2 emissions and for mortgage bonds and ship mortgage bonds also scope 3 emissions.

75 Spar Nord Annual Report 2024  Lending activities
Owing to its core banking and leasing activities,
the Bank is linked to indirect GHG emissions from its customers' assets and activities. In 2024, GHG
emissions from lending activities represented 33% of the Bank’s total GHG emissions.
The compilation of financed emissions related to
the Bank’s lending activities is based on Finance Denmark’s CO2 model for the financial sector,
which is based on the methods of PCAF (Partner-
ship for Carbon Accounting Financials) and the GHG Protocol. Fina nced emissions are calculated
respectively in absolute terms, which is an expres-sion of GHG emissions measured in tCO2e, and in relative terms, which is calculated in tCO2e per
DKK million lent.
The current statement of financed emissions from lending activities includes the majority of the
Bank’s total bank and leasing lending, but it is not possible to include the entire business volume in
the statement. This is because there are currently
no me thods that cover the entire business volume.
Spar Nord continuously follows the work of ex-
panding and improving the quality of calculation
principles and data and continuously aligns its
practice with the latest methods.
For the calculation of financed emissions for loans
to retail customers, the loans included in the basis
for the calculation of GHG emissions are related
to the product types directly linked to car and home financing. In 2024, the Bank's car and home
loans  amounted to DKK 15.6 billion, equivalent to
60% of the total loan portfolio to retail custom-

Question: Décrivez la manière dont le plan de transition pour l'atténuation des risques climatiques est intégré dans la stratégie commerciale globale la planification financière de l'entreprise.


Context: nan


Answer: Le plan de transition pour l'atténuation des risques climatiques de Spar Nord est intégré dans la stratégie commerciale globale et la planification financière de l'entreprise de plusieurs manières. Tout d'abord, le plan de transition pour l'atténuation des risques climatiques s'inscrit dans l'ambition de la banque d'atteindre la neutralité carbone d'ici 2050, en accord avec l'objectif de l'Accord de Paris de limiter le réchauffement climatique à 2 °C, avec une ambition supplémentaire de viser 1,5 °C. Cette ambition est un élément central de la stratégie de Spar Nord, qui se concentre sur la décarbonisation comme outil essentiel pour réaliser ses objectifs climatiques.

Ensuite, Spar Nord intègre les risques climatiques dans sa politique de crédit, en évaluant les risques physiques et de transition liés au changement climatique tant au niveau individuel des clients qu'au niveau du portefeuille. Cette évaluation est cruciale pour l'analyse du risque de crédit et est effectuée régulièrement afin de s'assurer que la banque peut continuer à financer de manière responsable tout en soutenant la transition vers des pratiques plus durables.

De plus, Spar Nord engage activement le dialogue avec ses clients et la société pour soutenir les plans de transition des clients et le développement de nouveaux modèles d'affaires respectueux du climat. Cette approche implique de rediriger les flux de capitaux vers des projets et des entreprises qui contribuent positivement à la lutte contre le changement climatique, ce qui est intégré dans la planification financière et les décisions d'investissement de la banque.

Enfin, Spar Nord effectue des estimations de gestion trimestrielles pour atténuer les risques de crédit liés au climat, ce qui influe sur ses prévisions financières et sa préparation à d'éventuels impacts économiques du changement climatique. Cette prise en compte proactive des risques climatiques dans les pratiques de gestion des risques de la banque montre son engagement à intégrer les considérations climatiques dans tous les aspects de sa stratégie commerciale et de sa planification financière.

		 Source:ples for Responsible Banking, the Bank has previ-
ously identified Sustainable Development Goal 13,
Climate Action and climate change as the Bank’s
most important impact area, as the Bank is as-
sessed to have bot h positive and negative impacts
on climate change. It was also on the basis of the
analyses from the work on the UN Principles for
Responsible Banking that the Bank’s core activi-
ties were first identified as an important area of
action in relation to clima te change. This recogni-
tion and conclusions from the analysis have been adopted in Spar Nord’s double materiality assess-
ment, where the Bank has performed a screening
of assets and activities related to climate change
as well as a mapping to identify where  in the
value chain the IROs materialise.
The table shows the significant IROs identified in
relation to climate change and the related sus-
tainability topics adaptation, mitigation and en-
ergy. The table indicates where in the value chain
the IROs materialise. Also listed are relevant inter-

of Directors of the Bank.
Spar Nord’s Climate Plan sets out the Bank’s cli-

with the Paris Agreement target of limiting global
warming to 2°C above pre -industrial levels, with a
further ambition to achieve 1.5°C. Spar Nord under-

Climate change mitigation actions
Climate change mitigation focuses on reducing
the causes of climate change by preventing fur-
ther GHG emissions. The goal is to slow down the
negative development, which is why decarbonisa-
tion is an important tool in the realisation of Spar Nord’s climate ambition and climate change miti-
gation actions.
Spar Nord is a bank built on commitment and
strong customer relationships. We believe that the
most responsible and effective climate transition
occurs by letting capital flow towards customers’
transition plans and the development of new cli-
mate -supportin g business models. Consequently,
we prioritise dialogue with customers and society
at large as a key element of our prioritised cli-
mate change mitigation actions and resources.
Spar Nord’s ambition is to support our customers
in making a sustainable transi tion of their busi-
nesses or personal finances. In the Bank’s advisory
services and dialogue, we focus on helping cus-
tomers leverage their existing strengths and new climate -supporting business opportunities.

mark as well as globally. These factors have a
negative impact on nature, clim ate, the environ-
ment, people and society. Climate change is un-doubtedly one of the greatest challenges of our time, calling for shared responsibility and collec-
tive action.
Spar Nord wants to contribute actively in the
transition to a sustainable and climate -neutral
society. This responsibility is particularly evident
when we make financing available to customers’
private finances or their businesses. Our custom-
ers' actions a nd ambitions are often reflected di-
rectly in the Bank's financing and investment ac-
tivities, and their demand for new sustainability -
supporting products to a large extent helps drive
the Bank’s development and initiatives.
Spar Nord continuously addresses the Bank’s resil-
ience to climate change and includes risk perspec-
tives in its climate change adaptation and mitiga-tion initiatives. The Bank handles climate -related

the Bank’s development and initiatives.
Spar Nord continuously addresses the Bank’s resil-
ience to climate change and includes risk perspec-
tives in its climate change adaptation and mitiga-tion initiatives. The Bank handles climate -related
risks, including transition risks and physical risks,
as an integral part of its traditional risk manage-
ment. For lending, Spar Nord makes specific stress
calculations on customers within the agriculture
and transport sectors as a direct consequence of
current and future CO2 taxes. For investment port-
folios, Spar  Nord also applies an increased focus
on resilience and climate considerations. We do this both from a risk perspective and based on the co-responsibility we have assumed as a financial
institution, which through investments facilitates capital flows around society. No portfolio- level
climate stress tests are carried out yet.
In Spar Nord’s current strategy 2023 -2025, we
have defined an ambition of being a committed
bank. This strategic direction also applies to our
contribution to the transition to a sustainable and
climate -neutral society and activities aimed at
climate chang e adaptation and mitigation. While
adaptation involves protecting society against consequences of current and potential climate
change, mitigation refers to activities aimed at
decarbonisation of society.
Through Spar Nord’s commitment to the UN Princi-
ples for Responsible Banking, the Bank has previ-
ously identified Sustainable Development Goal 13,
Climate Action and climate change as the Bank’s
most important impact area, as the Bank is as-
sessed to have bot h positive and negative impacts
on climate change. It was also on the basis of the
analyses from the work on the UN Principles for
Responsible Banking that the Bank’s core activi-
ties were first identified as an important area of
action in relation to clima te change. This recogni-

sub-targets. Read more about dedicated sustainability resources in the section on ESRS 2
Sustainability governance.
Climate change adaptation actions
Climate change adaptation is about making
changes and adjustments to deal with existing and future consequences of climate change. This
means focusing both in the short and long term on
reducing the damage caused by climate change,
which is already inevita ble.
For Spar Nord, the Bank’s climate change adapta-
tion measures relate in particular to the assets
and activities we finance through loans to our cus-
tomers. For example, we assess that businesses with significant GHG emissions over time will face
specific mar ket terms, more stringent regulatory
requirements and larger investment requirements
for climate initiatives. Climate challenges may
thus affect the robustness of a business and will
potentially impair its earnings capacity and
growth opportunities. Other things being equal,
this could limit the creditworthiness of a business. Companies applying a more environmentally sus-tainable profile are estimated to have a better
foundation for tackling any challenges imposed
by rising climate considerations.
To Spar Nord, sustainability risk is an inherent
credit risk assessed together with other credit fac-
tors. Assessments of, in particular, governance
factors have historically formed a part of the
basic credit assessment of business customers.
Physical and t ransition risks related to climate
change are also an element of the Bank’s credit
policy for assessing credit risk, both in relation to
the individual customer, but also at portfolio level.
Spar Nord makes quarterly management esti-
mates to mitigate climate -related credit risk. At
the end of 2024, the Bank’s management estimate

In order to operationalise the efforts and meet the
target for the under -represented gender at other
management levels, the Bank has set voluntary
targets for the under -represented gender as illus-
trated in the figure below.
In 2024, the under -represented gender represented
0% on the Executive Board, while the number was
16% in the group of executive managers. For man-
agers, the under -represented gender accounted
for 33%. Managers are defined as middle- manag-
ers who report to th e group of executive manag-
ers, e.g. heads of departments, etc.
Characteristics of own workforce
In 2024, Spar Nord employed 1,750 employees,
compared with 1,703 in 2023. The increase was to
a large extent attributable to more employees at
Spar Nord’s local banks and banking areas on
Zealand and within leasing and the Large Corpo-
rates area.  Out of the Bank’s 1,750 employees, 1,744 were per-
manent employees, distributed equally between
women and men.
In 2024, 1,501 of the Bank’s employees were full -
time and 249 part -time employees, corresponding
to 86% and 14%, respectively. At Spar Nord, mainly female employees use part -time employ-
ment. In 2024, 89% of part -time workers were
women.

ment. In 2024, 89% of part -time workers were

When compiling gender data, only legal gender
based on CPR numbers is considered. Spar Nord
fully recognises that employees can define them-
selves as something other than a woman or a man. For privacy reasons, the Bank has no gender-
differentiated registrat ion of information other
than legal gender and is therefore unable to dis-close this information.
In 2024, employee turnover was 7.2%, against 14.8% in 2023, which is a satisfactory level.
Collective bargaining coverage and
social dialogue
Spar Nord has signed the standard collective
agreement between Finance Denmark/Employer
and the Financial Services Union. Working condi-
tions and remuneration are regulated by the standard collective agreement for all employees.
However, the group of executive managers, corre-
sponding to 3% of the Bank’s employees, is only partly covered by the standard collective agree-
ment.
The Bank’s joint consultation committee acts on
behalf of all employees of the Bank. Likewise, all
employees are covered by general agreements
concluded between the Bank and the Financial Services Union “Spar Nord Kreds”. Whether an em-
ployee is represented  by the Financial Services Un-
ion “Spar Nord Kreds” in individual cases depends
on whether the employee in question is a member
of the Financial Services Union. If an employee is a
member of another trade union, representatives of that union can act as a co mpanion during the em-
ployee’s individual case.

index. The total response rate was 97% in 2024
compared to 98% in 2023. This means a total of
1,706 employees responded to the survey in 2024,
which Spar Nord believes is an indication that the employees are confident in our handling of the re-
sults. The overall well- being index was at a satis-
factory level of 90% in 2024 compared with 86% in 2023.
Follow -up and reporting on well -being goals
takes place annually from the HR department to the Bank’s Executive Board and Board of Directors.
Target for the under-represented gender
In order to achieve an equal gender diversity in
Spar Nord’s management, including the Board of
Directors, the Nomination and Remuneration Com-
mittee has set targets for the under- represented
gender, which have been approved by the Board of Directors. The t argets include statutory targets
for the Board of Directors and other management levels as well as voluntary targets for the Execu-
tive Board, the group of executive managers and
managers. Follow -up and reporting on targets for
the under -represented gender takes place annu-
ally from the Executive Board to the Nomination
and Remuneration Committee and the Board of Di-rectors.
The gender diversity in the Bank’s total workforce is largely equal between women and men,
whereas women constitute the under -represented
gender in the Bank’s management.
The targets set for the under- represented gender
are assessed as a step on the way to complying
with the new Danish gender balance act, but Spar
Nord is aware that the Bank’s targets for the un-
der-represented gender must be redefined in 2025
according to t he new act.

Nord is aware that the Bank’s targets for the un-
der-represented gender must be redefined in 2025

Gender diversity on the Board of Directors
Spar Nord has defined a target that the under -
represented gender on the Board of Directors
should represent at least 33% of the shareholder-
elected board members by 2025.  To support target achievement for the under -rep-
resented gender on the Board, the Bank in 2024 en-
gaged an external search partner to present qual-ified candidates of the under -represented gender
in connection with the recruitment of a new board
candidate.
In 2024, the Bank expanded the Board of Directors
by one new member elected at the general meet-ing, improving the gender balance on the Board.
Thus, the shareholder -elected board members now
count two women and five men, corresponding to
29% and 71% respectively. The Board of Directors
also consists of three members elected by the em-ploy ees, all of whom are women.
Gender diversity at other management
levels
For the other levels of management, a target has
been set for the under -represented gender to con-
stitute at least 20% by 2026. Other management
levels are defined as the Executive Board and
managers with HR responsibility reporting directly
to the Executiv e Board.

When compiling gender data, only legal gender
based on CPR numbers is considered. Spar Nord
fully recognises that employees can define them-

differentiated registrat ion of information other
than legal gender and is therefore unable to dis-close this information.
In 2024, employee turnover was 7.2%, against 14.8% in 2023, which is a satisfactory level.
Collective bargaining coverage and

Spar Nord has signed the standard collective
agreement between Finance Denmark/Employer
and the Financial Services Union. Working condi-

The sum of the responses to the ten well -being pa-

index. The total response rate was 97% in 2024
compared to 98% in 2023. This means a total of
1,706 employees responded to the survey in 2024,
which Spar Nord believes is an indication that the employees are confident in our handling of the re-
sults. The overall well- being index was at a satis-
factory level of 90% in 2024 compared with 86% in 2023.
Follow -up and reporting on well -being goals
takes place annually from the HR department to the Bank’s Executive Board and Board of Directors.
Target for the under-represented gender
In order to achieve an equal gender diversity in
Spar Nord’s management, including the Board of
Directors, the Nomination and Remuneration Com-
mittee has set targets for the under- represented
gender, which have been approved by the Board of Directors. The t argets include statutory targets
for the Board of Directors and other management levels as well as voluntary targets for the Execu-
tive Board, the group of executive managers and
managers. Follow -up and reporting on targets for
the under -represented gender takes place annu-
ally from the Executive Board to the Nomination
and Remuneration Committee and the Board of Di-rectors.
The gender diversity in the Bank’s total workforce is largely equal between women and men,
whereas women constitute the under -represented
gender in the Bank’s management.
The targets set for the under- represented gender
are assessed as a step on the way to complying
with the new Danish gender balance act, but Spar
Nord is aware that the Bank’s targets for the un-
der-represented gender must be redefined in 2025
according to t he new act.

managers. The distribution between women and
men at the senior management level is shown in
the table below. The table also contains the cate-
gory Managers, as Spar Nord also relates to and sets targets for gender diversity for this manage-
ment layer as described in the section Gender di-versity in relation to voluntary goals.  The Executive Board of Spar Nord consists of four
members, all of whom are men. In the group of ex-
ecutive managers, 16% were women and 84%
were men in 2024, while the distribution among managers was 33% women and 67% men.
Spar Nord wants a broad employee composition in
relation to age. In 2024, as part of the Bank’s
strategy, the focus has been on generational change and the recruitment of more trainees in or-
der to ensure a balanced age distribution.
Adequate wages
Spar Nord wants the Bank’s remuneration level
and principles to conform to the market, enabling the Bank to constantly be able to attract and re-
tain the right employees. The specific remunera-
tion of the individual employee is determined ac-
cording to an individual agreement, and the point
of departure is the job content, wage formation in
the market and the employee’s overall skills, ex-perience, performance and geographic workplace
with a view to ensuring equal pay for equal work
or work of equal value. All employees receive at least a salary negotiated under collective agree-
ments. Therefore, all salaries are considered ap-propriate and adequate.

The remuneration ratio shows the ratio between remuneration of the Bank’s highest paid individual
(the CEO) and the median remuneration of the
Bank’s other employees.
Incidents, complaints and human rights
In 2024, no complaints were filed, and no in-
stances of discriminatory treatment or violations,
including harassment, were recorded in the Bank’s
own workforce. Similarly, there were no incidents with a material impact on human rights or com-
plaints related to such matters.
The Bank has a response plan in place to handle discrimination and violations, should such inci-
dents arise. The HR department initiates the response plan and involves relevant parties, in-
cluding the management and the union repre-
sentative. Each employee is supported individu-ally, and the necessary assistance is provided. For
the sake of the employee, discretion is exercised. In
addition, the j oint consultation committee annu-
ally discusses the Bank’s guidelines and status in
this area with a view to ensuring  an effective re-
sponse plan.

long as the obligation remains in force.
In addition, it should be noted that the severance schemes are only activated if the service contract is terminated on the
part of the Bank or if the Bank takes part in a merger with or is acquired by another company, and the Executive Board member does not form part of the continuing entity. Under the severance scheme, termination on the part of the Executive
Board member will only lead to standard remuneration during a 6 -month termination period and no severance pay. In the
event of the death of an Executive Board member during the period of employment, a post- service payment equal to a
maximum of six months’ salary will be disbursed to the spouse, alternatively to any children under the age of 18.
Pension obligation
Like the other employees, members of the Executive Board and significant risk takers are comprised by defined contribu-tion pension plans.

Diversity metrics
The Bank’s senior management level consists of
the Executive Board and the group of executive
managers. The distribution between women and
men at the senior management level is shown in
the table below. The table also contains the cate-
gory Managers, as Spar Nord also relates to and sets targets for gender diversity for this manage-
ment layer as described in the section Gender di-versity in relation to voluntary goals.  The Executive Board of Spar Nord consists of four
members, all of whom are men. In the group of ex-
ecutive managers, 16% were women and 84%
were men in 2024, while the distribution among managers was 33% women and 67% men.
Spar Nord wants a broad employee composition in
relation to age. In 2024, as part of the Bank’s
strategy, the focus has been on generational change and the recruitment of more trainees in or-
der to ensure a balanced age distribution.
Adequate wages
Spar Nord wants the Bank’s remuneration level
and principles to conform to the market, enabling the Bank to constantly be able to attract and re-
tain the right employees. The specific remunera-
tion of the individual employee is determined ac-
cording to an individual agreement, and the point
of departure is the job content, wage formation in
the market and the employee’s overall skills, ex-perience, performance and geographic workplace
with a view to ensuring equal pay for equal work
or work of equal value. All employees receive at least a salary negotiated under collective agree-
ments. Therefore, all salaries are considered ap-propriate and adequate.
