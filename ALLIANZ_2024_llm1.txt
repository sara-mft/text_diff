SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT Sustainability Statement, which also fulfils the requirements for the Group non-financial statement prepared in accordance with sections § 315b to § 315c HGB

BASIS FOR PREPARATION

Allianz Group approach to sustainability reporting

How do we make sure action is taken? — Policies

How do we reach our ambition level? - Actions

Clarity in sustainability reporting is facilitated by the assessment of our progress in achieving our targets. The ESRS requires reporting on “actions” taken and how these actions address the relevant sustainability matters during the reporting period. Where reliable data points are available, we quantify our actions and assess to which degree these actions support our ambitions and concrete targets.

At Allianz, business decision-making is governed by our corporate rules and is subject to oversight. The section Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies outlines how we integrate sustainability matters into decision-making. Detailed corporate rules and other policies in the meaning of ESRS on specific ESRS topics are explained in the respective topical sections of the report and the section Allianz ESRS policies. Information on policies in the meaning of ESRS is highlighted in bold and dark blue.

Allianz’s purpose – We secure your future – guides our actions across the Allianz Group and drives us to pursue constant innovation and collaboration. It also guides our interactions with our customers, partners, employees, investors, governments, regulators, society, people with disabilities, and next generations across all our businesses. Our ambition is to actively support the transition toward a more sustainable economy in collaboration with our value chain, focusing on measurable actions, transparent reporting, and long-term positive impacts across societies, economies, and the environment.

Further key elements of our Sustainability Statement and our quality aspirations

What is our concrete ambition level? - Targets

Alongside our “policies”, “targets”, and “actions”, the Sustainability Statement explains our sustainability strategy and governance. These parts are key for understanding the context and diligence we apply in integrating sustainability at Allianz.

Where applicable, we set concrete targets related to relevant sustainability matters. These targets are our yardsticks defining our ambition level in the respective area. Following the ESRS structure, we include two sections on targets:

A core pillar of our sustainability ambition is to follow clear, transparent practices and provide high-quality, verifiable reporting that reflects our ongoing commitment to measurable sustainability outcomes. Our Sustainability Statement outlines the sustainability matters material for Allianz and how we address them. We adhere to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) structure, which focuses on key sustainability aspects (environment, social, and governance) and provides a robust disclosure framework for comparability and credibility. In alignment with these standards, we have structured our Sustainability Statement in key sections, as detailed in the following paragraphs.

At Allianz, we are committed to high standards of quality in our sustainability reporting. We recognize the need for reliable data and processes for robust business integration and to ensure our external disclosures are reason, we mandated PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, to perform a “reasonable assurance engagement”.

− the sustainability targets relevant to board remuneration in the section Board of Management target process, and − additional “targets” related to relevant sustainability matters in the topical sections of the report.

−

Summary boxes in topical sections of our Sustainability Statement

As fiduciaries, our asset managers have a responsibility to manage each client’s assets prudently in accordance with their specified portfolio objectives and guidelines. For this reason, our Asset Managers manage third-party client assets solely in consideration of these objectives and guidelines, and do not apply Allianz’s targets when managing these third-party client assets.

To help readers understand Allianz's sustainability topics, we have added blue summary boxes in each section. These boxes are a recommended starting point for anyone in Allianz's sustainability matters and how we address them. They are written in simple language and can be read separately from the more technical and regulated content.

Which sustainability matters are relevant for Allianz? - Materiality

In the section Materiality, we present the results of our Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) double materiality assessment, which defines the relevance of potential sustainability matters for our business. This section therefore outlines the ESRS topics material to Allianz.

Terminology used in our Sustainability Statement

Sustainability is an evolving topic with various terminologies provided by standard setters and market practices. To ensure understandability and comparability, we align our terminology generally with the CSRD and ESRS. In the German version of our Sustainability Statement, we may modify standard translations. We use “ESG” (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and interchangeably, depending on the context. Every time we mention “Allianz” in our Sustainability Statement, we refer to the Allianz Group as a whole, unless stated otherwise.

Basis for preparation of the Sustainability Statement Given the still due national transposition of the CSRD into German national law, the Allianz Sustainability Statement is compiled per the Non-financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) (Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU), which has been transposed into German law via § 315b to § 315c HGB, and ESRS (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 of 31 July 2023 supplementing Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council). The ESRS are considered a recognized European Union-based

54 Basis for preparation

framework under the NFRD. All references to CSRD Sustainability Statement also address the underlying ESRS.

This Sustainability Statement covers the Allianz Group and has identical been prepared on a consolidated basis, with consolidation scope as for our financial reporting as per the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Due to the inclusion consolidated Sustainability Statement of Allianz Group, subsidiary undertakings make use of the exemption to expand their management report to include a Sustainability Statement in accordance with Articles 19 (a) para. 9 or Article 29 (a) para. 8 of CSRD as transposed into national law as the case may be. We list the exempted subsidiaries in note 8.20 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Sustainability Statement covers material sustainability matters across our value chain, including

Insurance – Life/Health (re)insurance (Life/Health), Property and Casualty (re)insurance (Property-Casualty),

−

− Proprietary investments, − Asset management – third-party investments business, and − Allianz own operations (and Supply chain).

This includes our CSRD double materiality assessment, policies, actions, and targets, as well as metrics in line with ESRS requirements. The ESRS do not define an undertaking’s own operations. However, they provide a definition for value chain. As such, judgement needs to be applied to distinguish between own operations and downstream value chain, in our case especially where proprietary investments are concerned. Allianz’s policy considers the reporting of all our proprietary investments as part of our downstream value chain, including control. Notwithstanding, in our double materiality assessment we have not excluded anything due to this distinction. For the purpose of disclosures, we allocate our material impacts, risks, and opportunities based on the abovementioned policy. Sustainability matters for the third-party assets under management concern products that are available to a multitude of investors, governed by a publicly accessible AllianzGI or PIMCO prospectus and registered with a regulator. Further interpretations have been presented in the respective chapters for better readability.

All measures, activities, and key figures refer to the 2024 financial year (1 January to 31 December 2024). Allianz has not used the option to omit a specific piece of information corresponding to intellectual property, know-how, or the results of innovation. For the disclosure of the gender pay gap ratio in line with S1-16, we have applied the safeguard clause according to ESRS 2.5 (e) in conjunction with §§ 289e and 315c HGB.

Unless otherwise stated, the measurement of the metrics presented in the Sustainability Statement have not been validated by an external body other than our auditor. References to information published outside the Annual Report, Allianz Group’s Management Report, and the Remuneration Report are supplementary and do not form an integral part of this Sustainability Statement.

Use of estimates for our value chain

impacts, risks, and opportunities Allianz’s sustainability-related primarily arise from our upstream and downstream value chain, rather than our own operations, due to the nature of our business model. Therefore, our ability to drive positive change, mitigate risks, and capitalize on opportunities depends on how effectively we manage and influence sustainability practices beyond our own operations. To measure our sustainability performance, we also rely on estimates for our value chain, as obtaining the necessary information can vary depending on factors such as contractual arrangements and our level of control. As such, we supplement direct sources of information with indirect sources, such as sector-average data or other proxies. When using such estimations, we ensure they are based on sound methodologies appropriate for the context.

We apply the criteria of accuracy, relevance, and consistency to all estimates to ensure results are reliable and useful. Details regarding the metrics for which estimates are used, including their basis for preparation, scope, level of accuracy, assumptions, and potential sources of measurement uncertainties, are reported alongside the metrics in our Sustainability Statement.

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE

Allianz business model and value chain

− SDG 8 – Decent work and economic growth − SDG 13 – Climate action − SDG 17 – Partnerships for the goals

With proprietary investments and asset management on one side and insurance products and underwriting on the other, our downstream value chain is crucial to our business model. Insurance customers range from large corporate policyholders, mid-sized corporations and small- and medium-sized entities to private households, micro-undertakings, single consumers and end-users. The underwriting process includes our distribution channels, particularly agents and brokers, as well as claims handling, including claims steering, loss assessment/repair and settlement. Our investment management activities include our proprietary investment portfolio, with business relationships expanding to joint ventures, associates, and third-party asset managers. We address the needs of retail and institutional customers through our asset management services, which cover a wide range of equity, fixed-income, cash, and multi-assets products, as well as a growing number of alternative investment products, such as real estate, infrastructure debt and equity, real assets, liquid alternatives, and solution business.

The Allianz Group is one of the world’s leading insurers and asset managers, serving around 128 million customers 1 in almost 70 countries, including 112 million retail customers. As an insurer and asset manager, our main business activities include product and service development, marketing, distribution, sales, underwriting, claims premium handling, management, and asset and proprietary investment management. These key activities define our upstream and downstream value chain, as well as our own operations and related sustainability matters, from an impact, risk, and opportunity perspective. To conduct our business effectively, we use a range of inputs in the form of employees, information technology (IT), and respective infrastructure.

Climate change affects livelihoods, homes, health, and business continuity, and is among the biggest challenges we face today – not only for our business, but for the entirety of society 2 . This is why we are focusing our environmental efforts on climate change. Since 2005, Allianz’s climate change strategy has been integrated across our operations, as well as our insurance and proprietary investment businesses, and guides our efforts to actively support the transition to low-carbon economies and drive positive change.

Our social impact stems both from the nature of our business and our efforts to strengthen the resilience and well-being of the communities we operate in, such as our Corporate Citizenship initiatives and cross-sector partnerships, which focus on improving health, well-being, and employability for future generations. We are also committed to upholding human rights, lifelong learning, fair remuneration, health and safety, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

As our employees are key for Allianz, we have a dedicated strategy for developing and securing human resources, from hiring to retaining employees. Specifics on our workforce strategy are in the section S1 Own workforce.

For detailed information on our business strategy and model, see the Business Operations chapter.

To ensure IT stability, we follow procurement principles, prioritizing economies of scale, freedom from conflicts of interest, confidentiality, internal vetting, fact-based decisions, sustainability, compliance, and third-party risk management. These principles are anchored in our Allianz Group Standard for Procurement. The adequacy of the internal control system related to procurement activities is monitored through Allianz Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM). For information on our Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) and NFRM, see the section Operational risk of the Risk and Opportunity Report. As a financial services undertaking, Allianz is not dependent on specific suppliers and customers, given our vast supplier network and client portfolio.

However, sustainability challenges are too complex to tackle alone. True to our name “Allianz” – signifying alliance – we act as a trusted partner and collaborate with public and private sectors and civil society, contributing to systemic change toward a more sustainable future. By pooling resources, expertise, and innovation, we address these global challenges together. Our involvement in the UN- convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) exemplifies our commitment to bridging public and private sector action to address climate change.

Strategy

Allianz’s Sustainability Strategy

For many years, Allianz has strengthened the resilience of our customers and society, supporting current and future generations to grow and prosper. Our purpose, “We secure your future”, reflects our commitment to caring for customers and contributing to a better future.

We recognize the importance of human rights as both a value-based topic and a business issue, and we are committed to supporting and respecting the protection of human rights, in addition to ensuring that Allianz is not complicit in human rights abuses. The human rights that Allianz is committed to respecting are those agreed by governments in:

As a global insurer, investor, and asset manager, understanding and addressing sustainability issues is fundamental to reducing risks and capitalizing on opportunities. To focus our efforts, we align our priorities with three of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

Our upstream value chain includes purchased goods and services from suppliers like IT and software providers, contractors and other service providers, and reinsurance coverage from reinsurers. Allianz internal operations, including our own workforce and the property, plant, and equipment we use (e.g., buildings, data centers), form the backbone of our own operations, as they are required to perform our insurance, proprietary investment, and asset management activities.

the International Bill of Human Rights, comprising the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols, in addition to the core International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions, comprising the prohibition of child labor and forced labor, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, occupational health and safety, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

Allianz aims to identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate adverse human rights impacts linked to its business activities and operations, including our supply chain. Our approach is guided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). Our due diligence in own operations and supply chains complies with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (GSCA) and is covered by the

Allianz SE Human Rights Policy Statement. Please refer to the sections S1 Own workforce and S2 Workers in the value chain for further details. Our due diligence process for proprietary investments and commercial insurance can be found in the sections S2 Workers in the value chain and S3 Affected communities of this report.

At Allianz, sustainability is viewed as a journey across a dynamic and constantly evolving landscape. As such, we embrace the role of a learning organization. We acknowledge the ongoing enhancements of our impact, risk, and opportunity assessments as the maturity and availability of data, external credible sources, and independent standards continue to evolve, enabling us to effectively address the challenges of sustainability.

Further information on Allianz’s Sustainability Strategy elements across environmental, social, and governance matters, including information on services and customer categories, are detailed in the section Sustainability Integration and in the topical sections of the Sustainability Statement.

Interests and views of stakeholders

At Allianz, our success is built on stakeholder trust in our performance and integrity. Stakeholder engagement enables us to understand how we can have an impact and drive progress in addressing sustainability challenges and opportunities in line with our strategy, as they require collective solutions involving stakeholders from business, politics, and civil society. It ensures we can design products and services that amplify our positive contribution to social, environmental, and economic issues.

We use materiality assessment, customer surveys, and direct stakeholder engagement to shape our strategy, activities, and international and national reporting. Besides engaging with sustainability bodies and initiatives, we maintain regular dialogue with key stakeholder groups most impacted by our business. The purpose of the engagement is dependent on the stakeholder involved but will always aim to develop solutions that benefit all. Discussions with stakeholders and evolving expectations from Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have informed Allianz’s positions.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Engaging with communities As part of our non-listed proprietary investment and commercial insurance due diligence, we screen for potential and actual adverse impacts on affected communities, as documented in the Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability (ASIS), before engaging in business with a counterparty (for specifics, please refer to the section Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies). Beyond due diligence, we have additional mechanisms to engage with stakeholders, including affected communities:

Operational responsibility for the sustainability agenda lies with the Group Center Global Sustainability, which drives integration across the organization and business operations. It supports other Group Centers and subsidiaries in implementing the Group's sustainability strategy in a manner consistent with their operating models. Locally, the agenda is executed by sustainability management teams within subsidiaries and a comprehensive sustainability network. This ensures sustainability is embedded in Allianz's strategic and operational processes.

Governance

We are dedicated to clear and transparent governance principles. This includes our governance of sustainability matters as we work to embed and deliver sustainability objectives across our global business and organization.

Group Sustainability Board To support the Board of Management, the Allianz Group has established a dedicated Group Sustainability Board. It comprises members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE and Group Center heads, meeting at least quarterly. Ad hoc and regular exchanges address additional topics that could translate into material impacts, risks, or opportunities. During these meetings, sustainability- related matters from internal and external stakeholders are addressed, including all material impacts, risks, and opportunities from the double materiality assessment. For the list of our material impacts, risks, and opportunities, please refer to the section Material impacts, risks, and opportunities.

− We have engagement channels open to all, inside and outside Allianz, who feel impacted by Allianz’s business or a business in the Allianz value chain – for example, the Speak up tool.

Role of the administrative, management, and supervisory bodies

− We engage in regular dialogue with NGOs to discuss the possible social and environmental impacts of Allianz, including on affected communities.

Information about the administrative, management, and supervisory bodies, including its gender diversity, can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement and in the information of Allianz’s administrative, section Governance management, and supervisory bodies. This also pertains to information about the experience of the members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board relevant to sectors, products, and geographic locations.

Sustainability ratings We stay informed about changing stakeholder expectations through our participation in various sustainability ratings and benchmark studies, reflecting evolving public interest. For example, we participate in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), an annual evaluation of companies’ sustainability practices, and the MSCI ESG rating, which measures a company’s resilience to long-term financially relevant sustainability risks.

Core responsibilities of the Group Sustainability Board:

The subsidiary Sustainability Lead works with business and functional owners to integrate sustainability into the business and helps the Board member to manage internal and external stakeholders regarding sustainability matters. Depending on their size and the maturity of the sustainability integration process, subsidiaries may have sustainability teams focusing on a broad spectrum of sustainability topics.

Global Sustainability drives the integration of sustainability-related matters across the organization and business of Allianz. It also supports other Allianz Group Centers and subsidiaries in integrating the Group’s sustainability strategy into their processes and policy frameworks.

Risk management and internal controls over sustainability reporting

Several Group Committees play an important role in Allianz’s decision-making processes to embed sustainability. The Group Finance and Risk Committee oversees risk management and monitoring, including sustainability risk. The Group Underwriting Committee monitors the underwriting business, its risk management, and the development of internal rules and strategies, including sustainability integration. The Group Investment Committee focuses on fundamental proprietary investment-related topics, including sustainability matters.

The risk management and internal control processes for sustainability reporting encompass a framework for identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with sustainability initiatives. This includes the Allianz Functional Rule for Sustainability Reporting, which delineates processes and controls to ensure accurate and reliable sustainability reporting. The process leverages established financial reporting processes and includes the submission and approval of the Allianz Group Sustainability Statement (part of the Management Report) to the Board of Management. Measures are reinforced by regular internal audits. Data collection is facilitated through SAP systems which are also used for financial reporting, ensuring consistency and coherence across reporting platforms.

Human Rights Officer The Allianz Group Human Rights Officer monitors the effectiveness of the human rights risk management system for own operations and supply chains worldwide in line with the GSCA, and regularly reports to the Allianz SE Board of Management. Germany-based Allianz subsidiaries directly subject to the GSCA have responsibilities for monitoring risk management systems in their respective business areas.

Allianz Group Sustainability Network All other Group Centers take responsibility for sustainability within their functions, aiming to embed sustainability across Allianz’s organization and business. Global Sustainability and other Group Centers work with a network of sustainability and business experts across Allianz’s subsidiaries globally. They provide guidance and set standards to ensure sustainability their strategies and approaches. This network supports a Group-wide sustainability approach, shares best practices, and helps scale positive impacts across the organization.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

The reporting risk assessment approach adheres to a process for identifying and mitigating risks associated with reporting activities. This involves systematically identifying potential risks and implementing measures to mitigate their impact. The entire process is documented in the Allianz Functional Rule for Sustainability Reporting, focusing on key risks and key controls to manage and minimize potential reporting vulnerabilities with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities in the reporting process. This approach aligns with standards and methodologies used in financial reporting, ensuring consistency and coherence in risk assessment practices across reporting functions. By following this approach, the organization can proactively address reporting risks and uphold the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of its reporting activities.

The main reporting risks identified encompass the potential for misstatement and the dissemination of incorrect information. To mitigate these risks, a quality assurance process has been implemented at the level of the subsidiaries and at Group level. At the subsidiary level, the responsibility for non-financial data lies with the finance function, with data signed off by the local Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and local Chief Financial Officer (CFO) by means of a Statement of Accountability. At Group level, quality control involves the sign-off of content by content owners and Group Center heads with a Group Statement of Accountability. This approach ensures that the individuals responsible for the content verify its accuracy and completeness before dissemination, thereby serving as a critical control measure to mitigate the risk of misstatement and incorrect information.

The findings of risk assessment and internal controls regarding sustainability reporting processes have been integrated into the ongoing CSRD implementation project. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board receives quarterly updates about the CSRD implementation project. The project has a strategic plan to be transitioned to the line function by 2025.

Periodic reporting of findings from risk assessment and internal is communicated to administrative, management, and controls includes supervisory bodies disseminating pertinent information during Diligence Meetings. Furthermore, the Sustainability Statement is integrated into the Management Report.

MATERIALITY

To acknowledge trends relevant to Allianz’s business and stakeholders, and to align our sustainability strategy, implementation measures and reporting, we assess the materiality of sustainability matters regularly. In 2023, we conducted a double materiality assessment process in accordance with the CSRD and accompanying ESRS, covering impact materiality (impacts on people and planet) and financial materiality (risks and opportunities from a business perspective). The CSRD double materiality assessment (CSRD DMA) was updated in 2024 to capture the most up-to-date picture of our material sustainability matters. This allowed us to deepen our understanding of matters previously identified as material to our key stakeholders. The CSRD DMA is conducted alongside the Allianz Group’s value chain.

The process, methodology, and outcome of the DMA were reviewed and endorsed by our Group Sustainability Board and the Board of Management in 2024. In addition, Board of Management approval has been granted as part of the 2024 Allianz Group Annual Report sign-off process. The CSRD DMA forms the basis of our

Sustainability Statement and is reviewed and updated annually. The CSRD DMA for 2024 generally confirms the relevance of the previously identified material sustainability matters in 2023. While “cybersecurity” remains a relevant topic for the Allianz Group, respective information on how we address this topic is covered in the section Operational risk of the Risk and Opportunity Report regarding information security aspects and the sections S1 Own workforce and S4 Consumers and end-users regarding data privacy.

Material impacts, risks, and opportunities The statement of material impacts1, risks, and opportunities for Allianz is highlighted below. The CSRD DMA suggests that topics across all topical ESRS are generally material for the Allianz Group, with the level of materiality, the number of material sustainability matters, and the

primary drivers of materiality differing across topics. For example, while “Climate change” (ESRS E1) is material from an own operations and value chain perspective, the materiality of further environmental topics (ESRS E2-E5) is generally associated with providing financing and insurance to corporate customers. Social and governance-related topics are particularly relevant from our own operations perspective (especially ESRS S1, G1), while also playing a role in our value chain (especially ESRS S2, S3, S4). In addition to the “Climate change” (ESRS E1) and “Own workforce” (ESRS S1) topics, “Business conduct” (ESRS G1) remains a strategic focus for the Allianz Group. Also, our ongoing focus on customer experience alongside the customer journey remains unchanged (ESRS S4) given its materiality and relevance to the Allianz sustainability strategy.

The description of our material impacts, risks, and opportunities is detailed at the beginning of each topical section. The CSRD DMA results are not necessarily material to any particular subsidiary, but for the Allianz Group as a whole.

Resilience Analysis

Financial effects

matters not sufficiently covered therein, while considering (potential) significant differences between Allianz subsidiaries.

The capacity to address identified material impacts and risks and take advantage of Allianz’s material opportunities determines our resilience toward environmental, social, and governance matters, and is key for our strategy and business model.

Effects of identified material risks and opportunities can affect Allianz’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows over the short, medium, and long term. Current financial effects are those effects that are recognized in our primary financial statements for the current reporting period, i.e., as of 31 December 2024. Generally, disclosures related to the financial effects of material sustainability matters are included in our financial statements if required by the IFRS, which we apply as financial accounting principles. The overall impact of material risks and opportunities on the primary financial statements in the current reporting period is limited.

The DMA process includes multiple iterations of feedback and validation rounds with internal business owners and experts. It is informed by our sustainability-related processes and guidelines, implemented to address material impacts, risks, and opportunities. A yearly review and update of our CSRD DMA ensures evolving regulations and methodology are incorporated, while increasing the availability of portfolio-specific data where possible. This includes necessary recalibration steps by incorporating the most recent Allianz portfolio information, input from external data sources, and internal experts’ views.

impacts, Allianz has a governance structure to embed and deliver sustainability objectives across our global business, organization, and value chain, where applicable. This includes Group-wide binding rules via the Allianz Corporate Rules Book, setting targets, and adopting actions in our sustainability processes to address adverse impacts and continue delivering positive impacts.

We do not see significant risks of material adjustments within the next annual reporting period to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities due to recognized material risks and opportunities of the current reporting period. In general, our assets most at risk of material adjustments are our proprietary investments. Regular impairment tests and calculations are performed to reflect a current market and fair value view in the recognized asset balances. The same scrutiny is applied for other assets, such as our real estate held for investment, fixed assets from alternative intangibles and goodwill. As a global (re)insurer, our liabilities are dominated by (re)insurance contracts, which are accounted for under the insurance accounting provisions of IFRS 17. The IFRS 17 measurement models are based on estimates of present value of future cash flows, which comprise all cash flows expected to arise as the (re)insurance contract is fulfilled. In estimating these future cash flows, we incorporate, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date. Details on our accounting principles can be found in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Identified and assessed material impacts, risks, and opportunities serve as the foundation to define our prioritization strategy for setting policies, actions, and targets, where applicable, and to determine the adequate monitoring and steering level and frequency.

Regarding the analysis of our overall resilience to sustainability matters that could pose material risks, the ESG risk inventory conducted in 2024 forms an integral part. The ESG risk inventory captures the many ways in which Allianz’s business can be negatively impacted across all value chain dimensions by sustainability matters over the short, medium, and long term. It is based on a qualitative approach uniformly applied to all dimensions and sub-dimensions of the value chain and all sustainability matters specified by the ESRS. For each material risk in the risk inventory, the business functions must identify the mitigation measures to be applied and confirm their adequacy. These may be business processes that deal specifically with environmental, social, and governance topics, such as sustainability due diligence processes, that address both impacts and risks. These can also be general business processes, such as non-financial risk management processes, insofar as they deal with environmental, social, and governance issues. For medium- to long-term risks, initiatives that mitigation measures can also be projects and specifically address emerging environmental, social, and governance issues, such as the Green Building Initiative in property insurance. The broad diversification of Allianz’s business model, risk management, and capitalization – combined with the business functions’ assessment of the materiality of sustainability risks and the processes to manage them – confirm the resilience of our strategy and business model in terms of its ability to manage its material sustainability risks. For material climate change risks, further information on the resilience of Allianz's balance sheet, using scenario analysis, is presented in the section E1 Climate change.

We also engage in regular dialogue with key stakeholder groups that are impacted by our business, including affected communities. For details, please refer to the section Interests and views of stakeholders. Details on how we identify and assess material impacts, risks, and opportunities can be found in the section Methodology and process to identify and assess material impacts, risks, and opportunities.

ESRS disclosure requirements covered by the Sustainability Statement Allianz’s identified material sustainability matters trigger different disclosure requirements, datapoints, and metrics, which form the basis of our Sustainability Statement. We closely follow the ESRS provisions when setting our reporting boundaries, while at the same time considering the qualitative characteristics of the reported information, which encompass relevance, faithful representation, comparability, verifiability, and understandability. Metrics or qualitative information are only omitted when such information is not material in line with CSRD DMA, or is not applicable for Allianz and its business model as a financial undertaking.

Process to identify and assess material impacts, risks, and opportunities The CSRD DMA follows the double materiality principles as per the CSRD/ESRS, as well as the EFRAG Implementation Guidance on the value chain and materiality assessment from May 2024. The CSRD DMA identifies material impacts, risks, and opportunities that (may) arise in the short (up to one year), medium (from one to five years), or long term (more than five years), or a mix thereof. In terms of topical scope, the CSRD DMA covers both the sustainability matters addressed by the topical ESRS as well as Allianz-specific sustainability

A detailed list of the disclosure requirements complied with in our Sustainability Statement can be found in the section List of ESRS disclosure requirements complied with. The section Datapoints that derive from other E.U. legislation includes all datapoints that are derived from other European Union (E.U.) legislation.

For identified material opportunities, we ensure capacity by establishing clear ties to our strategy, securing the right priority to pursue them and take advantage of their likely materialization.

SUSTAINABILITY INTEGRATION

Our sustainability integration approach is based on the consistent application of sustainability rules, processes and governance within our own operations, and insurance and proprietary investment activities, focusing on areas such as climate change, social impact, responsible investment, human rights, and governance. Our asset management units have set up their own set of processes, rules and governance on sustainability integration in their investment activities. The approach involves assessing the risks, impacts, and opportunities; setting targets; measuring and reporting on progress; engaging stakeholders; and integrating sustainability considerations into our products and services in the transition to a more sustainable economy and a resilient society.

As an insurance company that manages risks ranging from single to cumulative events, it is important for the Allianz Group to make a holistic assessment of risks. This is why the sustainability risk management framework is also an integral part of the Allianz group- wide risk management framework. For further information on the Allianz group-wide risk management framework, please refer to the Risk and Opportunity Report. We manage material risks across our business with various policies and actions. These are implemented by our first line of defense, with the second line of defense responsible for monitoring and challenging risk identification and management processes in line with the Allianz Group Risk Policy (see section Allianz Group Risk Policy (GRP)). the Understanding

limitations of our subsidiaries helps us to develop global sustainability processes that can be integrated into local processes and systems. We continuously expand and strengthen our sustainability integration framework and risk management approaches to keep them current and relevant to our core businesses.

At Allianz, we also see regulation as a necessary driver in terms of integrating sustainability considerations in a structured manner, keeping competition fair and establishing a level playing field. In this context, Allianz aims to contribute expert input and leverage regulation to ensure consistent implementation across all Allianz entities, while simultaneously aiming to build business opportunities in line with regulatory concepts.

65 Sustainability Integration

Integration Framework provides transparency around our sustainability-related processes and guidelines.

Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies An integral part of our Corporate Governance is steering and exercising control over the Allianz Group via the Allianz Corporate Rules Book. We have in place multiple internal corporate rules that manage material sustainability matters across our value chain. These apply to the relevant underwriting, proprietary investments, and own operations activities, and require collaboration between relevant functions and business areas. Corporate rules in the meaning of the Allianz Corporate Rules Book are internal rule-setting documents issued by an authorized owner with the intention to establish binding regulations or guidelines for Group-wide relevant topics. Each corporate rule needs documented approval and undergoes regular reviews.

The Allianz Corporate Rules Book comprises four levels (from top to bottom):

− Allianz Group Code of Conduct − Allianz Policies − Allianz Standards − Allianz Functional Rules.

Adequately reflecting insurance and asset management specificities and the principle of proportionality and operational structure, corporate rules generally apply to all related entities of Allianz SE.

Adoption of Corporate Rules at Allianz subsidiary level and control processes at Group level

Allianz subsidiaries must establish corresponding appropriate Corporate Rules reflecting Group and local requirements and oversee their adoption throughout legal entities with respect to proportionality and operational structure.

Each responsible Group Function oversees the adherence to and implementation of the Corporate Rules in the subsidiaries.

“Policies” in the meaning of ESRS

For material sustainability matters, ESRS requires reporting on policies, actions, and targets. A policy in the meaning of ESRS specifies the strategy or management decision related to a material sustainability matter and typically defines a monitoring and control process.

Allianz documents qualifying as policies in the meaning of ESRS

Given the Group-wide application and approval and control processes of the Allianz Corporate Rules covered by the Allianz Corporate Rules Book, we consider our established Allianz Corporate Rules, i.e., Allianz Policies, Allianz Standards, and Allianz Functional Rules, to be policies in the meaning of ESRS.

Besides the Allianz Corporate Rules, e.g., the Climate Policy Statement of AllianzGI, the Allianz Group Vendor Code of Conduct (VCoC), and the Allianz Sustainable Procurement Charter qualify as ESRS policies, as they reflect and implement the Allianz Group strategy with a monitoring and control process.

Where the Sustainability Statement mentions policies, it refers either to Allianz Corporate Rules or the additional documents mentioned above. Different policies cover different parts of Allianz’s value chain. Some policies address several material sustainability matters, while others are tailored toward individual subjects.

Key policies for integrating sustainability into business activities are in the ASIS, the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU), and the Allianz Functional Rule for Sustainability in Investments (FRSI), while those for our own operations are in Corporate Rules for Procurement, Own Workforce, and Sustainable Operations. Following the policy framework set by Allianz Group, our asset management units have their own processes, rules, and governance, where needed and reasonable.

Detailed information on policies can be found in the respective topical sections and in the section Allianz ESRS policies.

Integrating sustainability in insurance

Rules-based risk assessments: We perform rules-based risk assessments, either automatically (e.g., retail business) or individually (e.g., commercial business). Risks (including sustainability risks) are accepted and priced based on exposure to hazards and the contribution to the performance of the overall portfolio. This ensures the monitoring and management of risk accumulation, including guidance on limits and minimum requirements.

pillars, including physical risk management, which contribute towards managing material risks and impacts and capturing opportunities.

Our ambition is to transition our global proprietary investment portfolio to net-zero by 2050, with the management of climate change risks firmly integrated into our investment processes. For example, we have conducted climate stress testing to understand the physical and transition risks posed to our proprietary investment portfolio; please see the Climate-related risks section for more detail. We consider certain nature-related topics material to our portfolio and are developing a systematic approach for these areas. We implement best practices across all of our asset classes, guided by recommendations from NZAOA, PRI, and the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC).

Embedding sustainability in our insurance business helps us to manage risks and seize opportunities for sustainable development.

impact, we aim to share our sustainability expertise with customers, agents, brokers, and business partners, and use it to develop our own sustainable solutions and services. We research claims, underwriting profitability, as well as emerging issues like rising natural disasters, and perform sector analyses to identify growth opportunities and new service and advice solutions.

Technical Price (TP) System: Following the principle of pricing adequacy, we use the TP System to appropriately price the risks, including sustainability risks. The TP is reviewed continuously and in full at least annually to reflect the latest internal and external factors.

Product and Portfolio Management: Our insurance products are designed considering changing risk patterns and sustainability requirements through our Sustainable Solutions initiative. Subsidiaries must assess and classify new products and services against the Sustainable Solutions Certification Grid. Annual contract renewals allow quick adaptation to sustainability changes, like climate change, as part of continuous portfolio management.

The processes described below are in place to meet the objectives of the ASU.

Described below are the key processes in place to manage sustainability risks, impacts, and opportunities. These are set out in the FRSI described in the section Allianz Functional Rule for Sustainability in Investments (FRSI).

Sustainable Solutions

The Allianz framework for sustainable products and services (Sustainable Solutions) for our Property-Casualty lines is primarily based on regulatory requirements (i.e., the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation) and includes additional product elements which contribute to sustainability objectives beyond climate change adaptation to support our customers in their transition. Further details are in the E.U. Taxonomy section.

Selecting, appointing, and monitoring asset managers

Claims handling: Claims handling is a key process to manage claims events which stem from physical environmental-related risk effectively. The claims, actuarial, and underwriting departments make estimations of the expected size and resourcing impacts of an environmental event, using tools such as GIS to estimate high exposure regions, ensure preparedness, and then use the number of notified claims during the initial aftermath. If claims exceed a defined threshold, the affected subsidiary sets up a task force with pre-defined responsibilities and processes, including the potential to outsource and use partner networks. Response plans are documented, and claims processes are regularly reviewed and improved. Referral processes and restrictions

A central process in our proprietary investment management is selecting, appointing, and monitoring asset managers. We prefer asset managers with investment and stewardship processes aligned with our Sustainability Strategy. We have defined minimum expectations, monitoring, and engagement practices for public and private asset managers, and we review them against these expectations. Asset managers need to have and adhere to their own qualified sustainability rule set, as outlined in the FRSI. If an asset manager cannot meet this condition, an engagement escalation process is triggered. We hold regular review meetings with our listed- asset asset managers to discuss sustainability performance as well as specific issuers that meet our Adverse Impact Steering (AIS) trigger points. These processes also apply to our internal asset managers (AllianzGI and PIMCO), which manage the majority of our proprietary assets. We work with internal and external asset managers via mandates, informed by benchmarks and guidelines integrating our sustainability preferences.

Sustainability-related risk management in insurance

Our exposure to sustainability risks in insurance is mostly indirect, through the insurance coverage we provide. Transition and physical risks can resonate as transmission channels to other traditional insurance-related risks, such as underwriting and pricing risks. These risks are managed through underwriting, pricing, claims, and product development, depending on the business lines. For example, an underwriting tool calculates the risk of accumulation in our property insurance portfolios. Diversification across insurance products also helps mitigate these risks. Traditional insurance risk management tools, such as setting limits, reinsurance, and self-retention policies, also manage sustainability risks within our portfolios. Managing sustainability-related risks is integrated into the actions taken to manage other relevant risks within our insurance portfolios:

in line with the energy guidelines are also in place to identify sustainability issues within our insurance business; these are governed by the ASIS and described in the section Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability (ASIS).

Integrating sustainability in proprietary investments All Allianz proprietary investment assets are covered by an integrated sustainability approach which closely follows the recommendations of the PRI and is continuously enhanced. This is based on six different

Tool deployment: We use tools such as the Geographic Information Service (GIS), referral rules, and inspections to analyze exposure and risk. This enables relevant pricing terms for insurance policies, considering changing sustainability risks and customer needs.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Adverse Impact Steering (AIS) for listed assets

For listed assets, the AIS process is used to systematically evaluate and manage material sustainability risks and principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors. Through the AIS approach, we determine trigger points based on data provided by MSCI ESG Research for sustainability risks or controversies (human rights, governance, labor rights, UNGC compliance), as well as adverse impacts from toxic emissions and waste, biodiversity, and land use (Principal Adverse Impact Indicators). Investee companies with AIS trigger points are further assessed, often in close collaboration with our asset managers, and discussed regularly during asset manager sustainability review meetings. We decide on next steps, which may include engagement with improvement objectives or restricting the issuer. Trigger points are evaluated and updated at least every three years, while investments in issuers below AIS trigger points are monitored centrally.

Referral process for non-listed assets

For details of sustainability integration into our non-listed proprietary investments and the referral process, please see section Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability (ASIS).

Active engagements

Engagement is key to our active ownership approach and aligns with PRI Principle 2: “We will be active owners and incorporate sustainability issues into our ownership policies and practices”.

The FRSI defines the process for our engagement program. We perform bilateral engagements (between Allianz and the target company/issuer) based on the AIS process, multilateral engagements on strategic topics like climate, biodiversity, pollution, or human rights, and asset manager engagements on the listed and non-listed side. Our active engagement strategy aligns with Allianz’s goals and business objectives, as we believe that companies and asset managers that effectively address sustainability concerns are less likely to encounter or contribute to events that harm their business performance. Through our engagements, we seek to help companies to address sustainability risks and opportunities and support portfolio companies and asset managers in developing or expanding their sustainability governance and processes.

67 Sustainability Integration

We consider real-world decarbonization crucial, as climate change threatens our insurance offerings and poses a systemic risk to our proprietary investment portfolio. Climate change is a key focus of our engagements, driving portfolio decarbonization and transition to a low-carbon economy. This often includes asking companies to take accelerated action to decarbonize their operations and value chain, in addition to aligning their corporate lobbying to position themselves as leaders in their sectors in line with their business interests. In rare cases, we restrict companies due to failed engagements. Engagement program details and progress are reported to the Group Sustainability Board. The following table gives an overview of active engagements in proprietary investments; it includes engagements Allianz Investment Management conducts as an asset owner as well as those conducted by our internal asset managers with companies where Allianz proprietary assets are invested, following the engagement policy of the respective asset manager.

Sustainable Investments

Allianz classifies investments as sustainable if they are E.U. Taxonomy aligned or, according to our definition, are aligned with the requirements set forth by the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Article 2 (17) complying with the following criteria: 1. Positive contribution to an environmental and/or social objective; 2. Adherence to the ‘Do no significant harm’ principles; and 3. Follow good governance practices.

Our sustainable investment approach covers a breadth of sustainability topics (environmental, social, and governance) and all the major asset classes that we invest in. For a detailed description of our sustainable investment methodology, please see the Explanatory Notes on the Allianz company website.

Restrictions

In line with our guidelines on thermal coal, oil sands, and oil and gas, and as we see the future of these business models endangered, we restrict certain fossil fuel companies or projects (divestment for equity and run-off for debt investments). For more details, see section E1 Climate change.

Allianz prohibits investments in controversial weapons as defined in the ASIS. Since 2023, we have placed further restrictions on companies not complying with the U.N. Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Our internal experts assess countries’ human rights risk exposure using NGO information and in-house research.

and investment horizons. Integrating relevant factors does not mean ESG-related information is the sole consideration; PIMCO’s portfolio managers and analysts consider various factors and their materiality when making investment decisions. By increasing and diversifying the information available to the Portfolio Management Team, PIMCO can provide a more holistic view of an investment, which they believe will benefit customers. For further details, please refer to PIMCO’s Sustainable Investing Report.

The aforementioned classifications from AllianzGI and PIMCO follow their respective definitions and do not aim to meet the definitions of any regulation, including but not limited to Sustainable Finance regulation.

Physical risk management

For further details, please refer to the AllianzGI Sustainability website.

For fully owned real estate and prospectively all material single location assets, a proprietary Allianz tool must be used to assess physical climate change risk. Whenever a certain level of physical risk is identified, an adaptation plan is required to be implemented.

PIMCO

PIMCO defines strategies as strategies that include: its assets under management in sustainability

Integrating sustainability in own operations We consider human rights as a minimum standard for the treatment of our employees. We conduct annual and ad-hoc assessments of risks to employee rights per the GSCA. If we find risks, we take preventive measures. If we find violations, we remedy them promptly and effectively (see our Policy Statement on Human Rights).

Integrating sustainability in asset management1 The Allianz Group’s asset management segment sees the integration of sustainability factors as an important industry driver, where appropriate. As active managers with proven research capabilities, our two major asset managers, AllianzGI and PIMCO, work with customers interested in sustainability aspects on investment strategies and considerations to help them achieve sustainability-related objectives.

− Minimum standards that refine the investment opportunity set (“exclusionary” based on client-directed exclusion criteria portfolios);

− Enhancing the sustainable characteristics of the portfolio in comparison to its investment universe (“enhanced” portfolios); or − Achieving a specific environmental/social objective in addition to

a financial objective (“thematic” portfolios).

We have implemented measures to minimize risks to human rights and labor standards in our own operations. These include:

For customers seeking greater sustainability orientation in their portfolio, PIMCO manages a dedicated suite of mandates that follow sustainability strategies and guidelines. These strategies utilize the three building blocks of PIMCO’s ESG portfolio construction process: limit exposure to sectors and issuers with higher ESG risk factors; emphasize issuers with leading and improving ESG risk mitigation strategies and those who seek to capitalize on ESG operations and business models; and engage constructively with issuers to help influence ESG and sustainability practices over time.

AllianzGl

− The protection of human rights is enshrined in our corporate rules, depending on local laws and requirements.

Investing under the consideration of sustainability aspects is core to AllianzGI’s strategy. AllianzGI has continued to build out its offering of sustainable and impact-focused investment products and customized solutions across public and private markets. It has identified three themes – climate change, planetary boundaries, and inclusive capitalism – critical to society, investors, and AllianzGI. These themes inform its research, stewardship activities, product development, and industry commitments. AllianzGI’s ESG-themed strategies are classified as follows:

− Anonymous feedback tools and surveys let employees evaluate issues like workload, wages, and diversity.

− Extensive measures ensure physical safety and improve health and well-being.

− Training in sustainability-related issues, including equal treatment and occupational health & safety, at Group and subsidiary levels.

PIMCO believes that the consideration of relevant ESG factors is part of the investment research process. ESG factors may be important inputs when evaluating long-term investment opportunities and risks across asset classes in both public and private markets.

The Allianz Group Code of Conduct reflects Allianz’s values and principles, guiding employees in their actions and decisions. At Allianz, we expect employees to support and adhere to human rights in alignment with international standards. For further information, please refer to the section Allianz Group Code of Conduct.

Incorporate material ESG risk considerations into the investment process across all asset classes to seek enhanced risk-adjusted returns without restricting the investment universe.

PIMCO recognizes that ESG factors are increasingly essential inputs when evaluating global economies, markets, industries, and business models. The relevance of ESG considerations in investment decisions varies across asset classes, strategies, products, valuations,

Through our insurance portfolio (Property-Casualty retail and commercial), we are linked to (potential/actual) material indirect impacts. Adverse impacts on climate change mitigation originate from the insurance of carbon-intensive activities or policyholders with operations in higher GHG-emitting sectors, as also reflected through our insurance-associated emissions (entity-specific sustainability matter). This is a current reflection, however – as we work to implement our net-zero transition plan, such adverse impacts for the current portfolios are expected to decrease over time.

Insurance

Regarding positive impacts in our insurance portfolio (Property-Casualty retail and commercial), we offer insurance products in line with our Sustainable Solutions framework. This framework facilitates the coverage of climate-related hazards and GHG mitigation efforts and technologies of our policyholders, thereby positively contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation.

Through our proprietary investments, we are linked to (potential/actual) material indirect impacts of our investees and assets. Adverse impacts on climate change mitigation originate from providing funding to investees or assets with operations in higher GHG-emitting sectors. This is a current reflection however – as we work to implement our net-zero transition plan, such adverse impacts for the current portfolios are expected to decrease over time.

Proprietary investments

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long-term)

Regarding positive impacts, we are focused on enlarging our portfolio of Sustainable Investments, which positively contribute to climate change mitigation by supporting the transition to a climate- neutral economy.

In managing assets for external parties, we are linked to (potential/actual) material indirect impacts which issuers, governments, or other assets in our asset management portfolios might have. As the global economy is at the beginning of its transition towards climate-neutrality, issuers’ and governments’ activities are currently associated with a higher carbon footprint, with adverse impacts on mitigating climate change.

Asset management

Given our ESG-themed strategies for third-party assets, which include impact investing and other sustainability strategies with a focus on climate change mitigation, we also assess our impacts in our asset management to be positive, as these strategies support the transition to a climate-neutral economy by providing related funding.

Adverse impacts in our own operations on climate change result from the GHG emissions associated mainly with the energy usage of our operations and the business travel of our employees. While positive mitigation measures are in place in the form of energy-saving practices and renewables usage, we still consider our adverse impact to be material.

Sustainability matters

For our retail and commercial Property-Casualty business, climate change is expected to drive an increase in the frequency and severity of claims. These may be derived from both an increase in policyholders’ exposure to the physical risks of climate change as well as the consequences of transitory measures intended to mitigate or adapt to climate change, such as adopting new technologies, materials or processes with a poorly understood (insured) risk profile, legal developments, or changes in customer behavior. Especially within our Commercial business, insured parties may be subject to climate change-related litigation due to alleged greenwashing incidents, responsibility for damages due to their historical greenhouse gas emissions and other potential issues. For our Retail business, customers may require new products or coverages in response to decarbonization-related lifestyle changes; Allianz may also suffer reputational damage if our own decarbonization efforts fall short of stakeholder expectations. Some risks may be offset with premium increases, but tangential issues such as insurance affordability for customers, difficulty in pricing risks with limited historical risk data, or increased loss-ratio volatility may present challenges.

For our Life/Health business, an increase in acute physical events, such as storms, floods and droughts, alongside chronic weather-related conditions such as desertification or a geographical shift in disease-carrying vectors, may lead to adverse developments in mortality and morbidity rates. From a transition risk perspective, uncertainty around potential new regulations and requirements for climate-related investments and insurance products may inject uncertainty into Allianz’s strategic planning. Finally, if Allianz fails to provide a suitable offering of sustainable products to meet customer expectations, or is perceived to have overstated the sustainability characteristics of the company's products or organization (i.e. greenwashing), reputational damage and a loss of market share may occur.

Risks

Our proprietary investments may be impacted by adverse developments in investment returns due to physical and transition risks. On the physical side, decreases in investment valuations may be triggered by acute and chronic weather events; both directly in the form of damage to underlying real assets as well as indirectly in the form of disruptions to business continuity, supply chains or resource availability. Decreases in valuation may also occur solely due to an increase in investees’ exposure to physical climate change risks. On the transition side, a combination of climate change-driven changes in technological, regulatory, legal and consumer behavior may adversely impact investment performance insofar as these materially disrupt the business model of investees. This includes, for example, transition-related disruptions to the cost, quality, and availability of inputs an investee relies on to run their business; a significant increase in investees’ regulatory compliance costs or legal losses, or a decrease in customer demand for the investees’ products or services.

For our own operations, an increase in extreme weather events may increase the likelihood of operational disruptions, both directly and due to disruptions experienced by key suppliers. Decarbonization efforts are also acting as a catalyst for broad regulatory changes, including regulations impacting the insurance industry. The design and implementation of processes needed to comply will require investments in employees, external expertise, third party databases, IT systems and more. Together with an increase in operational complexity, such new regulations may drive an increase in compliance or process failures and operational losses.

Opportunities are considered material for our insurance portfolio (Property-Casualty retail and commercial) in that we are supporting our customers in their low-carbon transition journey in accordance with our Allianz sustainability strategy and targets as part of our Sustainable Solutions and low-carbon solutions.

Climate Change Strategy and Net-Zero Transition




Allianz’s net-zero transition plan substantiates our long-term commit- ments to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for proprietary investments, Property-Casualty insurance, and own operations. To deliver on our ambition, we have set intermediate targets for 2030, with key decarbonization actions encompassing restrictions on fossil fuels, strategically steering our portfolios, engaging with stakeholders (particularly our clients and investee companies), improving energy management across our operations, and scaling up support of renewable energy and low-carbon technologies. We are well on track to achieving our targets. However, the transition will be complex, and we recognize that achieving our net-zero commitment will require significant collaboration with policymakers, regulators, and other key stakeholders to drive the transition.

Human-made climate change has already caused significant adverse impacts for nature and people. The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to restrict warming to 1.5 °C, emissions need to be almost halved every decade and reach net-zero emissions by the middle of the century to maintain a reasonable chance of achieving this goal. However, if current emission trends persist, climate scientists estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) budget will be exceeded before 2030, which necessitates urgent climate mitigation efforts from policymakers and businesses.

We expect climate change will have significant impact on global economies and our business. The risks and opportunities we see emerging today from the transition to a low-carbon economy will transform and increase over the mid to long term, driven through technological progress, changes in consumer sentiment, increasing costs from regulatory compliance on disclosing physical climate risks

or operational disruptions caused by more extreme weather events and ecosystem degradation.1

Our climate change strategy guides our response to impacts, risks and opportunities to drive decarbonization and climate resilience across our operations and insurance and proprietary investment businesses. Through our resources, partnerships, expertise, and influence, we aim to be a trusted partner for our clients and investee companies across different sectors in their transition toward net-zero.

As such, to anticipate and enable the net-zero transition, Allianz has committed to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 for our proprietary investment and Property-Casualty insurance portfolios and set 2030 intermediate targets, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5 °C by the end of the century, taking into account the best available scientific knowledge, including the findings of the IPCC.

71 E1 Climate Change

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

− For our Proprietary investment (Corporates) portfolio, we target a 50 % reduction in absolute GHG emissions for listed corporates, and a 50 % reduction in our gross-emission intensity for listed and non-listed corporate exposure by 2030, both against a 2019 baseline.

− For our Proprietary Investment portfolio (Real Estate), we have set 2030 intensity targets that are aligned with the second version of the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM).

− For Commercial insurance, we target a 45 % reduction in the insurance-associated emission intensity of our in-scope sub- portfolio of large corporate companies insured by Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE (AGCS), for which GHG emission data is available, by 2030 against a 2022 baseline.

− For Motor Retail insurance, we target a 30 % reduction in the absolute carbon emissions within our in-scope portfolios by 2030, against a 2022 baseline.

− For our Operations, we target a 65 % reduction in the emissions per employee against a 2019 baseline.

In 2024, we made positive progress towards achieving our 2030 intermediate targets. For our proprietary investment (corporates) and commercial insurance targets, this was driven by portfolio steering, including implementation of the Allianz fossil fuel restrictions, engagements with and decarbonization efforts by our investee companies and insurance clients. Carbon emissions reductions for motor retail insurance were influenced through expanding the share of battery electric vehicles in our portfolio and mileage reductions. Here, we anticipate the need for market decarbonization to support further target achievement. The reduction in carbon intensity within our proprietary investment (real estate equity and debt) portfolio is a result of increased renewable energy utilization and energy efficiency improvements. In our own operations, despite an increase in post-

Covid business travel, we reduced GHG emissions per employee by 62 % (versus 2019 baseline), through lowering our energy consumption and meeting renewable energy targets. We increased our proprietary investments in low-carbon solutions 1 by an additional € 6.5 bn, bringing the total to € 43.5 bn. Similarly, our revenue from insurance of low-carbon solutions grew by 25 % against 2022, driven by expansion in on-shore wind, solar and battery manufacturing for electric vehicles. We recognize that the net-zero transition is complex, and achieving our targets is also dependent on changes in and multilateral efforts with public policy and the real economy.

Further details on our target achievement and drivers for progress are outlined in the respective sections below.

requirements for specific technologies have been developed to ensure a positive impact for the underlying insured asset/activity.

72 E1 Climate Change

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Policy inventory and governance related to Climate Change Mitigation Our climate change strategy is firmly anchored in Allianz’s well- established sustainability governance (as outlined in the section Sustainability strategy and governance and integrated through group-wide corporate rules, such as the ASIS, FRSI, and the ASU, which are further detailed in the section Allianz ESRS policies).

Within ASIS, Allianz has four energy-related guidelines in place: thermal coal, oil sands, oil & gas, and renewable/low-carbon energy. The guidelines are owned by Global Sustainability and authorized by the Allianz SE Board of Management. They apply to proprietary investments and commercial Property-Casualty insurance, including facultative reinsurance. Their common goals are to contribute to the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy technologies, to manage sustainability and reputational risks, and to contribute to emission reduction targets for the GHG-intensive parts of our portfolios.

The three fossil fuel guidelines define business practices and business models where we do not provide further services or investments along defined technical exclusion criteria. They typically differentiate between single-site restrictions – which apply to stand- alone Property-Casualty covers, as well as direct project investments – and restrictions on company-level exposures. To support renewable and low-carbon technologies, we allow ring-fenced coverages of and investments into projects of companies that are otherwise restricted due to the fossil-related energy guidelines. This is described in the Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy Guideline. The guidelines were introduced in 2015 (thermal coal), 2021 (oil sands), 2022 (oil & gas), and 2023 (renewable/ low-carbon) respectively.

Ultimate responsibility for all matters relating to sustainability resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE as the Group’s parent company. This includes climate change and the net-zero transition plan, which has been approved by the Board of Management. Climate-related matters are typically part of all Group Sustainability Board meetings, which are held at least quarterly. The Supervisory Board is not required to formally approve the net-zero transition plan, however, the Supervisory Board is informed of the plan and provided with the level of transparency needed to execute their role of oversight. In line with our sustainability governance principles, Allianz SE has established a process for sustainability progress monitoring. Business units set milestones and provide progress information for regular updates via Global Sustainability to the Chair of the Group Sustainability Board. More information on how business units monitor progress is detailed in the respective sections below.

73 E1 Climate Change

Climate policy dialogue Achieving our net-zero commitment is contingent upon multilateral efforts with public policy and the real economy, as the necessary changes require widespread support. Our net-zero commitment and ability to implement decarbonization actions depend significantly on governments fulfilling the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement through swift, stable, and reliable public policies, action plans, and regulations. This includes the need for adequate frameworks and market incentives to enable the transition of the global economy along 1.5 °C pathways. The private sector needs to play an important role in supporting actions toward this transition. In pursuit of this, we actively engage with policymakers and regulators to support sustainable financing and achieve the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. We are advocating for effective global climate policy which should achieve the following:

long-term governmental climate targets, climate strategies, and emissions reduction plans, following the latest climate science in line with pathways of no or low overshoot of a 1.5 °C temperature rise. − Developing sector policies to promote a swift and socially fair transition, including the development of more granular short-, medium- and long-term net-zero infrastructure plans. Implementing stringent carbon pricing to internalize the external costs of pollution, including a phase-out of direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies.

− Protecting nature and supporting regenerative forestry and agriculture, and supporting and redirecting fossil fuel-related subsidies to scale up new technologies that will provide solutions in hard-to-abate sectors, e.g., carbon capture and storage, and green hydrogen.

including transition plans, GHG emissions, associated reduction targets, and alignment with 1.5 °C trajectories, ideally aligned internationally. − Sustainable finance regulation that provides a defined, science- based, and reliable framework via a common taxonomy of sustainability, clarification of asset managers’ duties related to sustainability, inclusion of sustainability in prudential regulation, and enhanced transparency of corporate reporting.

Climate engagement and partnerships Since the net-zero transition is a systemic issue, it requires a whole-of- society response. Therefore, we are also seeking to join forces with

other stakeholders. Our approach on the proprietary investment side builds on the work of the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which Allianz co-founded and chaired from its inception to year-end 2024. Furthermore, we encourage companies to implement net-zero strategies via initiatives such as the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, Climate Action 100+, and the PRI. Engagements support the decarbonization of our portfolios and the transition to a low-carbon economy and are considered an important action toward the achievement of our net-zero commitments. Our engagement approach is further outlined in the subsequent sections below, and in the section Sustainability strategy and governance. Similarly, for our supply chain, we also expect 100 % of global framework vendors (i.e., vendors providing products and services under global master agreements with Allianz SE) to have made a public commitment to net-zero GHG emissions in line with a 1.5 °C path by 2025.

The subsequent sections outline our approach for insurance, proprietary investment, own operations, and associated risks in greater detail.

Allianz 2030 intermediate targets: alignment with 1.5 °C pathways We consider our impact on climate change to result from the GHG emissions generated from our business (Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions). For Scope 3, category 15, our reporting boundaries are in line with GHG Protocol so that currently, assets under management owned by third parties and unit-linked funds are not part of the emissions reporting boundaries at Allianz Group.

In line with our net-zero commitment, we have set intermediate targets for 2030, which are further underpinned by actions toward achieving our targets. Our emission targets are aligned with credible, science-backed climate scenarios – such as those provided by the IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report. Further scenarios used include the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s Net-Zero by 2050 and the One Earth Climate Model; these limit global warming in 2100 to 1.5 °C with only a limited or no overshoot of this temperature during this century. While the in their assumptions and narratives (including global future economic and public and private policy developments), they agree on a necessary emission reduction range for CO2 emissions of 36 % to 69 % from 2020 to 2030, with a median reduction of 48 %. For GHG emissions, the range is 34 % to 60 %, with a median of 43 %. All our existing sub-portfolio targets for our operations, proprietary investments, and Property-Casualty insurance with a global focus are aligned with this emissions reduction range.

Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Insurance-Associated Emissions Standard.

Our target year 2030 is defined as year-end 2029. The base year for our 2030 targets for proprietary investments and own operations is 2019, which allows us to filter out the temporary effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic. The approach taken for our Property-Casualty insurance targets was to focus on the most recent year for which data was available; this was 2022 at the time of defining the base year. For all of our intensity targets, in addition to factoring in expected portfolio growth, our target definition was also informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization, modeled using authoritative scenarios such as the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) of the IEA.

For Scope 2, emissions are from purchased electricity, heat, and steam. There is no obligation for Allianz to continue purchasing electricity, heat, or steam from non-renewable sources and therefore we do not consider any Scope 2 emissions to be locked-in. However, even though in practice they are not locked-in, Scope 2 emissions, especially location-based, could be difficult to reduce due to practical and financial constraints, e.g., finding an alternative, affordable, and sustainable supplier of district heating.

We will continue to enhance our carbon footprint disclosures and scope coverage as methodologies, data, and standards improve. For more information, please see section Methodology information for climate metrics. Our targets have not been separately validated by an external body. We regularly monitor and report on progress toward our 2030 targets to the Group Sustainability Board. We also formally assess our performance at least annually in this context. Detailed information on these disclosures and targets is presented in the subsequent sections, which focus on our proprietary investments, insurance, and own operations.

For Scope 3, our assessment of potential sources of locked-in emissions from significant categories of Scope 3 emissions is ongoing, and we will consider an approach to specify these over the coming years.

Our 2030 intermediate targets are both absolute and intensity GHG emission targets. Absolute GHG emissions refer to an absolute amount of GHG emissions associated with the respective business activity such as investing or insuring; absolute GHG emission targets seek to reduce the absolute amount of GHG emissions. Conversely, GHG intensity emission targets harmonize the GHG emissions through a denominator that relates to a business activity, such as GHG emissions per million euro invested, or per million euro of premium.

In the past reporting year, we did not directly finance carbon removal. We also did not use carbon removal, allowances, and associated carbon credits when accounting for our GHG emissions and associated reduction targets or beyond our value chain. Our net-zero commitment will likely require the use of atmospheric carbon removal in the respective net-zero targets year. For this, we expect to only use high-quality carbon removal. Our current focus remains on GHG emission reductions, and we will transparently disclose our selection criteria once implementation commences.

Within our operational assets, we consider those which are incompatible with the transition to a climate-neutral economy to be those with locked-in emissions.

In our proprietary investment and insurance portfolios, we monitor our exposure to entities which require significant efforts to transition or are incompatible with a climate-neutral economy, and we have implemented actions to manage these. See the sections Climate change mitigation for our insurance portfolio and Climate change mitigation for our proprietary investment portfolio for more details.

Since the total GHG emissions across the Scopes, particularly Scope 3, is unknown to date, we have not yet set an overarching reduction target, instead prioritizing the reporting boundaries for our 2030 intermediate targets on those parts of the portfolio and own operations where established and credible GHG accounting standards, target-setting methodologies, and reliable emissions data are available. Furthermore, we do not yet include the Scope 3 emissions of our investee companies and insurance clients in the disclosures on Scope 3 category 15 proprietary investments and insurance-associated emissions (i.e., Scope 3 of Scope 3). Here, we are limitations with data availability and currently constrained by consistency at the necessary scale, and more importantly, at the required level of reliability and validity. As part of our efforts in this respect, we have included an estimate range for the magnitude of the Scope 3 of Scope 3 emissions for our proprietary investments in corporates, by assessing the actual portfolio data available and comparing this to estimated data from verified sources. We will continue to monitor developments in this area, and develop our disclosures as appropriate. Additionally, for our motor retail and commercial insurance portfolios, we have made important progress in measuring insurance-associated emissions (IAE) and have set emission reduction targets in 2023. While we deem IAE as not mandatory under E1 of the ESRS, we have developed an entity-specific metric to report these emissions, based on the methodology of the Partnership for

Allianz Group does not meet any exclusion criteria stated in Articles 12.1 (d) to (g) and 12.2. of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 and is thus not excluded from E.U. Paris-aligned benchmarks.

Qualitative analysis of locked-in emissions In the absence of an established methodology to calculate locked-in emissions, we have undertaken a qualitative assessment of our potential sources of locked-in emissions by Scope, based on expert judgement. We recognize that this is an area that may evolve in the coming years, so we will continue to monitor this.

In the subsequent sections, we outline the integration of the transition plan into our business strategy and how we assess and address the impacts, risks, and opportunities of climate change mitigation.

Overall, we do not believe the identified sources of locked-in emissions jeopardize the achievements of the GHG emission reduction targets that we have set for 2030. As part of our commitment to net- zero by 2050, we plan to manage the transition of these sources of locked-in emissions.

Introduction to Allianz Group decarbonization levers levers for For our portfolio targets, there are generally two decarbonization to reduce GHG emissions: either our portfolio companies – i.e., the customers and activities we insure or the companies we invest in – reduce their GHG emissions, or we change the composition of our portfolio over time through portfolio steering. The former relies directly on GHG emission reductions in the real economy, which are not under our control. The latter can occur naturally as part of typical insurance and investment business cycles in different lines of business, sectors, and individual customers, and is generally more under our control.

For Scope 1, locked-in emissions are due to owned assets in Allianz Group’s real estate portfolio or assets for own use which have existing fossil fuel-based heating systems and are not due to be decommissioned immediately. In addition, vehicles which are part of Allianz’s owned fleet are not considered locked-in emissions as they are part of our 2030 Green Fleet target.

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

We aim to achieve GHG emission reductions through actions, such as engaging investee companies and customers, increasing exposures to lower-carbon business, setting targets for low-carbon solutions (outlined in the section Climate-related opportunities below), and reducing our exposure to defined fossil fuel business such as thermal coal, oil, and gas.

The main decarbonization levers in our own operations are renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and green mobility, with key actions comprising renewable electricity procurement, reduction of electricity and heat consumption, green fleet, and air travel decarbonization.

The Allianz Group is not dependent on the allocation of resources because our specialized in-house teams drive the progress of our actions and the implementation of the transition plan, and these teams are implicitly incorporated into the financial plan. Experts must be deployed at a corporate level to ensure actions follow Allianz’s sustainability strategy, and at an operating entity level to ensure technical implementation. Further, Allianz’s ability to implement actions depends on data availability and collection, both in terms of its own operations and business activities.

Climate change mitigation for our insurance portfolio




Section summary

To deliver on our net-zero transition plan, the Allianz Group has set a strategy for climate change mitigation in our Property-Casualty insurance portfolio, with 2030 intermediate targets. The strategy is governed by the ASU, with the objective of supporting sustainable insurance practices by all Allianz Group entities.

in insurance-associated emission intensity by 2030, against a 2022 baseline for the in-scope sub-portfolio of large corporate companies insured by AGCS for which GHG emission data is available. For motor retail insurance, we target a 30 % reduction in absolute carbon emissions by 2030, against a 2022 baseline, for in-scope portfolios in nine key European markets. Strategic actions include supporting and engaging with customers on their decarbonization plans, steering the decarbonization of our portfolios and developing insurance offerings for low-carbon solutions. Progress is regularly monitored and reported, ensuring we remain on track to meet our ambitious targets.

Policies related to climate change mitigation for our insurance portfolio The Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU) governs the rules the and principles Allianz Group and is described in the section Sustainability integration. The ASU requires the support of all Allianz Group entities for sustainable insurance. Allianz SE is a signatory of the UN-backed PSI1, which defines sustainable insurance as a strategic approach where all activities in the insurance value chain, including interactions with stakeholders, are done in a responsible and forward-looking way by identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks and opportunities associated with environmental, social, and governance issues. Sustainable insurance aims to reduce risk, develop innovative solutions, to environmental, social, and economic sustainability.

The aims of sustainable insurance are detailed in the section Sustainability strategy and governance and consist of developing sustainable business opportunities future developments on the transition to net-zero, safeguarding against reputational risks, and taking corporate responsibility for our planet and for future generations. Specifically for climate change mitigation, the aims include, but are not limited to, Allianz Group’s commitment to transition operational and attributable GHG emissions from its insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as related (intermediate) target setting.

Subsidiaries are required to set underwriting criteria, engage with (potential) customers on GHG-emitting activities, and develop insurance offerings for low-emission and zero-emission technologies. The Allianz Energy Guidelines, also referred to in the ASIS, on Coal, Oil Sands, and Oil & Gas business models, and the related restrictions apply as defined by those Statements. For further information on the ASU, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS policies.

GHG emissions of our insurance portfolio The table below provides an overview of the insurance-associated GHG emissions. The table shows data from the previous year, current emissions, and our target emissions. To calculate IAE for both commercial and motor retail insurance, we follow the PCAF standard.

### END TABLE 


For the portfolio in scope of the emission reduction target for commercial insurance, the 2024 insurance associated emissions were 1.02 mn t CO2e1 and the insurance-associated emission intensity was 0.23 kt CO₂e/€ mn Insurance Premium2.

The IAE for a commercial insurance policy is equal to the GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from the policyholder multiplied by the attribution factor provided by PCAF (insurance premium of the policy divided by the revenue of the customer). Additionally, specific assumptions for policies covering risks of assets linked to Renewables and Low-Carbon technologies are taken to discount the IAE linked to these policies.

For commercial insurance, an emission intensity reduction has been achieved in 2024 compared to the baseline, decreasing from 0.26 kt CO2e/mn € Insurance Premium in 2022 to 0.23 ktvCO2e/mn € in 2024. This marks an 11.7 % reduction from the 2022 baseline and a 6.4 % increase compared to 2023.

For the motor retail portfolios covered by the emission reduction 3 (Scope 1 and target, the 2024 absolute IAE were 1.95 mn tvCO2 Scope 2 emissions), calculated in line with the PCAF Insurance standard.

To calculate the IAE of the in-scope portfolios, the emissions of the insured vehicles (Scope 1 from fuel combustion and Scope 2 from indirect emissions from electricity generation) are multiplied by the attribution factor for personal motor. The global attribution factor is provided by PCAF and represents the insurance industry's share of the total cost of ownership of a vehicle.

An absolute emission reduction has been achieved in both 2023 and 2024, compared to the baseline, reducing to 2.03 mn t CO2 (2023) and 1.95 mn t CO2 (2024), from 2.10 mn t CO2 (2022). This highlights a total 6.8 % reduction compared to the 2022 baseline.

Targets related to climate change mitigation for our insurance portfolio We have set GHG emission reduction targets for our commercial and motor retail portfolios.

Commercial insurance For commercial insurance, our target is to reduce the insurance- associated emission intensity of the in-scope sub-portfolio by 45 % by 2030 against our 2022 baseline. The target focuses on the large corporate companies insured by AGCS for which GHG emission data is available. For 2024, this cohort represented 13 % of the premiums in the for which emission accounting methodologies are currently available.

Assuming a static portfolio in terms of 2024 business volume, our intensity target of 0.14 kt CO2e/mn € insurance premium would correspond to associated absolute GHG emissions of 0.63 mn t CO2e for 2030. This figure is an illustrative view rather than an accurate representation of the expected absolute emissions in the target year and will change due to our dynamic portfolio. As our portfolio grows in business volume and data coverage increases, enabling us to report on more of the portfolio, we expect the associated absolute GHG emissions to grow as well.

While the decision to define an intensity target allows us to reflect the expected growth of our portfolio by 2030 in a dynamic way, we have ensured that our targeted reduction is still within the scenario range to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. Specifically, we have aimed to set an emission reduction target in the ranges of the IPCC net-zero scenarios by 2030. We also considered a growth in premium to simulate business growth while considering the resulting increase in insurance-associated emissions. In addition to factoring in expected portfolio growth, our target definition was also informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization, which we modeled using authoritative scenarios such as the STEPS scenario of the IEA and publicly available and verified company commitments.

The targets were developed with the support of dedicated teams at AGCS and finally approved by the Group Sustainability Board.

To monitor progress against the target, the insurance-associated emissions and the emission intensity will be reported. The metric to be compared year-on-year will be the emission intensity. In addition, an analysis by decarbonization lever will be performed. The levers are insured customers decarbonization and portfolio steering. Insured customers decarbonization is the annual change in customers’ emission intensity. The portfolio steering lever is the percentage change in the insurance-associated emission intensity attributed to the relevant key actions. Allianz will maintain a consistent methodology to calculate portfolio emissions and simulate levers required to allow for consistency with the baseline portfolio.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Motor retail insurance For motor retail insurance, our target is to reduce the absolute carbon emissions within our in-scope portfolios by 30 % by 2030 compared to our 2022 baseline. The target covers nine key European markets, namely: Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the U.K. For 2024, the in-scope portfolios within these markets represented 53 % of the motor retail premiums in the same year. These markets were chosen to focus on the most relevant and largest motor markets for Allianz where adequate and reliable data was available. The in-scope portfolios were classified in line with the PCAF standard for personal motor. The target only covers CO2 emissions, in line with the data which is currently available.

Our target setting is aligned with pathways to limit global warming to 1.5 °C and was informed by market decarbonization, modeled using scenarios from an external data partner. The pathways simulated developments in the motor market and ranged from an “as is” status to a “net-zero” status by 2050. We took a conservative view on potential emission reductions from continued real-world changes and focused on developing decarbonization levers to bridge the gap between market changes and the total required emission reduction to align with our 2030 targets. When setting the targets, we considered future developments such as: decarbonization of the real economy and implementation of government decarbonization commitments, as well as changes in customer behavior such as driving less or the increased use of public transport/e-mobility. When considering potential initiatives, we took into account future projections in the nine in-scope markets, including energy usage, vehicle usage, and vehicle types. Our initiatives therefore balance the improvements we expect to see in the respective markets with Allianz’s actions aimed at closing the gap to our stated targets. We will thereby actively steer our in- scope portfolios to be more sustainable whilst benefiting from changes we predict from market behavior. For further information, please refer to the section Climate Change Strategy and Net-Zero Transition.

Stakeholders leading the decarbonization topic in each market were involved from the outset, from initial baselining activities to the road-testing of the proposed and final targets. The targets were developed with the support of experts within in-scope subsidiaries and reviewed by the Group Sustainability Board. This was followed by the final approval of the Board of Management. For the motor retail IAE baseline, the GHG inventory boundary is the nine European markets described above, which is consistent with the scope of the CO2 emission reduction target. Currently, we have defined an entity-specific

77 E1 Climate Change

metric to calculate the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of customers using the PCAF methodology. Allianz will continue to use PCAF as the standard for calculating insurance-associated emissions while reporting on the target progression to ensure the consistency and replicability of the reported values. A yearly calculation of the insurance-associated emissions of the target portfolio is performed and reported, with in- scope markets providing quarterly updates throughout the year. The main metric to be compared year-on-year will be the absolute emissions of the in-scope portfolios. In addition, for the insured customers decarbonization lever, an analysis of the real-world economy (e.g., customer CO2 emission reductions and implementation of governmental commitments) is compared with the expected reduction. For the portfolio steering lever, the change in absolute emissions will be calculated and attributed to the respective actions. The changes will then be compared with the relevant expected CO2 reduction contribution ranges.

We selected 2022 as the baseline year for our insurance targets as it is the most recent year with the best data availability and was not significantly impacted by COVID-19. Setting an emission reduction target for the underwriting portfolio is aligned with the objectives of the ASU and demonstrates corporate responsibility and safeguards against reputational risks by actively mitigating the company’s environmental impact. The target also fosters environmentally conscious decision-making, thereby developing sustainable business it builds resilience by preparing the opportunities. Additionally, company for stricter future regulations and market demands for lower emissions, ensuring adaptability in a transitioning economy.

Decarbonization levers and actions related to climate change mitigation for our insurance portfolio For both commercial and motor retail insurance, we have two insured customer decarbonization and decarbonization portfolio steering.

Commercial insurance For commercial insurance, there are four key actions that contribute to the decarbonization levers.

Insured customers decarbonization

The customer decarbonization action refers to the change in a customer’s own emission intensity. The customer’s emission intensity is the absolute GHG emissions of the customer (tons of CO2e) divided by

their revenue (€). Customer decarbonization relies entirely on changes occurring within the customer’s business, independent of any underwriting decision or action taken by Allianz. The contribution of this action is the percentage difference of insurance-associated emissions assuming the same portfolio composition as the baseline year, but with customer emission intensity values of the current year.

Engagement on net-zero transition

Engaging our customer on advancing the net-zero transition is an important priority. We conduct three types of engagement with our customers:

Through Transition Engagements, we seek dedicated exchanges with selected insured companies in high-emitting sectors. For this action, we have set a target to have extensive and focused engagements with two to three customers every year on their net-zero is to discuss the alignment of their strategies. The purpose decarbonization strategy and objectives with Allianz’s net-zero commitment for its underwriting portfolio. For these engagements, we will target and screen our portfolio for high-emitting companies who have not yet developed science-based net-zero strategies for 2050.

Furthermore, we are conducting Transparency Engagements with customers on their climate and sustainability reporting efforts to increase the amount of high-quality GHG data for measurement of our own GHG footprint and further understand the management of emissions by our customers. In 2024, we started engaging customers in Germany and the U.K..

Finally, we are conducting knowledge-sharing engagements with customers in hard-to-abate industries. In 2024, we continued to engage with customers in the aviation and marine sectors on decarbonization strategies and technologies.

The AGCS sustainability team assists with the selection of engagement candidates and prepares the engagement interactions, which are conducted jointly with the distribution and underwriting teams.

Since we cannot quantify the contribution of engagements on the decarbonization of our commercial insurance portfolio, we do not report a separate value for this action.

In 2024, we engaged with six customers on their net-zero strategies and commitments. The focus was on customers in the oil and gas sector that are in scope of the company restrictions arising from the Allianz Statement for Oil and Gas-related Business Models. Due to the number of customers in scope of this Allianz Statement, a higher number of engagements than expected was conducted in 2024.

In 2024, our revenue (in terms of Gross Written Premium) from Low- carbon solutions grew by 25 % compared to the baseline year 2022. The year-on-year increase for 2024 is 8 %-p, primarily driven by growth in on-shore wind, solar, and electric vehicle battery manufacturing.

Restrictions

We are also applying the Allianz energy guidelines, which relate to discontinuing restricted business linked to coal assets or companies falling under restriction criteria for thermal coal, oil sands, oil & gas. For further information, please refer to the section Policy inventory and governance related to Climate Change Mitigation.

Portfolio steering In terms of portfolio steering, the key actions are as follows:

Low-carbon solutions

We aim to continue scaling up renewable energy and low-carbon solutions in our portfolio. By 2030, we intend to profitably grow revenues from low-carbon solutions in Commercial Property Damage as well as Business Interruption coverages by 150 % versus 2022. The 150 % growth target in low-carbon solutions is directly linked to the development of sustainable business opportunities stated as an in the objective underwriting portfolio, the Allianz Group will enable business activities that are expected to mitigate the climate impact of its underwriting portfolio. The scope of the target covers Commercial Property Damage and Business Interruption insurance linked to technologies or processes that fulfill the low-carbon technology criteria. As new technologies continue to be developed to address low-carbon emissions, the scope of the definition and target might expand to include these new technologies. To monitor the progress against the target, low-carbon solution gross written premium growth versus the baseline will be reported on an annual basis.

Insured customers decarbonization is presented at lever level. The specific impact of Allianz’s engagement actions cannot be directly attributed and quantified.

Further portfolio changes

Finally, the remaining reduction in emissions intensity will be reached by changing the portfolio mix. Following the reduction effect from other key actions of the portfolio steering lever, a change in the portfolio mix will be applied to the overall emission intensity of the target portfolio.

While the reductions achieved last year are presented as exact percentage figures, they are best estimates. Expected GHG emissions reductions are presented as ranges. The lower boundaries in the table reflect expected maximum decarbonization effort and the upper boundaries reflect minimum decarbonization effort.

the decarbonization levers employed for the portfolio in scope of our commercial target.

In 2023, the insurance-associated emission intensity decreased by 16.6 % against the 2022 baseline. This was mainly driven by the customer decarbonization lever. Since our portfolio consists of corporate companies, many of which have seen revenue increases as a downstream effect of increased energy prices and inflation, this effect also contributed to our insurance-associated emission intensity decrease. The restrictions based on Allianz’s energy guidelines further reduced the emissions intensity of the portfolio by lowering the exposure to high-emitting companies. The emission intensity reduction over 2023 was higher than the expected reductions in subsequent years.

and potential customers noted within plan figures, excluding all customers who currently drive BEVs. This enables engagements with customers who own higher-emitting vehicles and are yet to make the transition to more sustainable mobility options. The individual targets have been set in collaboration with subsidiaries. Subsidiaries have provided their planned year-on-year customer engagements to enable progress to be tracked. When combined, they meet the Group target of 20 million engagements by 2030. The Group uses established reporting processes to track progress against these planned engagements.

focuses on these in-scope subsidiaries where the biggest impact can be made due to the subsidiaries having the largest motor portfolios.

In 2024, the impact of the customer decarbonization lever on the emission intensity levelled out. Growth in customer revenue balanced the increase in customer emissions, which led a to a small increase in emission intensity. Portfolio steering actions aligned with Allianz energy guidelines and growth in low carbon solutions contributed to emission reductions. For 2024, further portfolio changes are driven by increased premium from new and existing customers which increased the emission intensity. This impact is in line with scenarios we have considered. As a result, the aggregated reduction in insurance- associated emission intensity for 2024 against the 2022 baseline was 11.7 %.

The required target will vary from year to year as progress will be tracked against the percentage of BEVs in the respective markets, which is a variable factor. We have partnered with a reliable external data provider to obtain data on the in-scope markets and ensure consistency in data collection across markets and across years. The targets have been discussed in collaboration with subsidiaries and Mobility Initiative Steering Committee members. As part of the initiative, subsidiaries have provided action plans which aim to ensure they embed initiatives which improve Allianz’s reputation in mobility insurance within their respective markets. These mobility action plans are aligned with the more comprehensive decarbonization roadmaps, which detail all actions planned to reach our 2030 targets. The Group has again used established reporting processes to track progress against these planned initiatives.

For the remaining period until 2030, we expect reduction effects from the levers as described in the table above.

Based on the current emission intensity reduction progress, we believe we are on track to achieve the 45 % reduction target by 2030.

Motor retail insurance For the motor retail portfolio, there are three key actions underpinning the decarbonization levers, all of which apply to the nine key European markets in scope of the GHG emission reduction targets.

The table below presents the % of BEVs in the subsidiary portfolios, compared to the % in the subsidiary markets. The ratio between the two being above 1 highlights the Allianz Group’s commitment to ensuring the growth of our BEV portfolios.

Engagements conducted in 2024 include engaging with customers via online platforms, social media, newsletters, and various marketing campaigns. Although engagements were taking place prior to this, the reporting process was not in place and therefore the number is not reported.

Engagements with customers on net-zero transitions

Targets on low-carbon solutions for motor retail insurance

For insured customers decarbonization, we aim to engage with 20 million current and potential customers between 2022 and 2030 to support their transition to electric mobility, mainly through Allianz- developed online platforms, newsletters, and advertising. The 20 million target reflects the current and estimated future number of customers in the markets defined as in scope who do not currently own a battery electric vehicle (BEV). Engagement will include focusing on the benefits of switching to electric mobility and the practicalities of doing so, for example, home charging infrastructure and insurance options. As insurance plays a key role in enabling the roadworthiness of vehicles, engaging with our policyholders allows us to have a sustainability-focused discussion with our customers. By actively engaging with customers on their options when it comes to mobility, we can help them make conscientious and well-informed decisions on impact. In addition, engagement with the their environmental customer allows us to communicate the sustainability-related policies set by the Allianz Group to our customers to highlight the proactivity of our actions.

### END TABLE 


In 2024, six of the nine markets in-scope reported engagements. Of the three markets which did not report engagements in 2024, there was a focus on creating credible roadmaps for future engagements. It is therefore expected that all nine markets will report engagements in 2025.

Low-carbon solutions

Within our portfolio steering lever, we aim to adjust the mix of our portfolio such that the share of BEVs (number of passenger vehicles) in the Allianz motor portfolio will exceed the share of BEVs within the in-scope markets by 2030. Our growth target for BEVs is linked to our mobility initiative and the development of profitable sustainable business opportunities, as stated in the ASU. One way in which Allianz aims to support the transition to more sustainable forms of mobility is by encouraging customers to BEVs. By providing comprehensive offerings, Allianz is enabling the transition to more sustainable forms of mobility. This action has a direct impact on our target to mitigate the climate impact of our motor portfolios. To reach our target, in-scope subsidiaries are engaging with the mobility initiative to drive profitable growth in electric mobility. The target

The share of BEVs in the subsidiary markets increased from 2023 to 2024 by a larger factor than the share for the Allianz portfolio, which led to a reduction in the ratio. This was also partially driven by some of the data on Allianz portfolios not being reported at 2023, which has been addressed for 2024.

Encouragingly, the 2024 ratio continues to be above target (> 1) and the share in Allianz portfolios continued to increase.

In order to meet the target of engaging with 20 million current or potential customers, individual targets have been provided to each in- scope operating entity, based on their current number of customers

Further portfolio changes

Within our portfolio steering lever, we aim to embed further portfolio changes the gap between expected market decarbonization and the Allianz Group targets. To ensure viability as well as collaboration, each in-scope subsidiary created a roadmap detailing portfolio actions to be taken as well as the associated planned impacts year-on-year. These subsidiary roadmaps have been combined to create the Group roadmap, which details how the Allianz Group will reach its 2030 motor retail decarbonization targets. One example is to enable a change in the portfolio mix toward electric mobility, we are committed to offering comprehensive insurance products for BEVs and the related ecosystem in order to support our customers in transitioning to this new technology. Our goal is to support the transition by adapting to the evolving mobility landscape around BEVs and emerging mobility trends. This strategy is an ongoing project with key deliverables, global exchange,

monitoring, and reporting. We will focus on offering mileage-based products, which will ensure fair and risk-adequate pricing for our customers which aligns with our technical excellence program. We strive for a better understanding of BEVs and the new mobility trends by leveraging our data and thus improving the accuracy of our risk models. We are committed to understanding the risks, gathering data, and being actively involved in research to ensure our net-zero plan invests in society to the benefit of all.

For the targets on emission reduction, customer engagement, and the share of BEVs, discussions took place with each operating entity, before progressing to the Sustainability Board and finally the Board of Management for approval.

To define the decarbonization levers and actions for the motor retail portfolio, Allianz considered four scenarios provided by an external data partner. The scenarios projected market developments, and ranged from an “as is” scenario to a “net-zero” scenario up to 2050.

### END TABLE 


The insured customers decarbonization lever includes the specific impact of Allianz Group’s engagement actions which cannot be directly attributed and quantified. This lever also includes the calculated impact from customer decarbonization, using data from our external data provider.

While the reductions achieved during 2024 are presented as exact percentage figures, they are best estimates taking into account potential overlaps.

In 2024, the reduction was mainly driven by the portfolio steering lever and specifically further portfolio changes, which encapsulates changes in vehicle mix and distances travelled within the in-scope

portfolios. For the remaining period until year-end 2029, we expect the majority of reduction effects in portfolio steering to come from our share of BEVs and a reduction in average mileage driven, due to portfolio actions such as improved products and tariffs.

For the period until year-end 2029, the majority of the expected emissions reduction will be significantly influenced by customer decarbonization, indicated by pathway projections. The impact from market decarbonization is expected from market changes, such as vehicle improvements and grid improvements, as well as government policies. To close the gap to our targets, action is needed by governments, to aid our portfolio steering efforts.

Allianz decided to adopt the second-most conservative, which included emission reductions by continued real-world changes, including government pledges and commitments, to develop its decarbonization levers. Therefore, our actions have been developed to close the gap to net-zero.

the decarbonization levers for our motor retail portfolio. Each lever is into specific actions, highlighting their respective broken down contributions to reducing CO2 emissions. The table tracks the percentage decrease in emissions compared to a baseline target value, covering the period from the beginning to the end of 2024. Additionally, it projects future developments and anticipated emission reductions through to the end of 2029, represented in ranges to account for potential variability. The lower ranges in the table reflect the maximum decarbonization effort and the upper ranges reflect the minimum decarbonization effort.

During 2024, our focus was on understanding and quantifying the actions which can be taken in our portfolios to reach our targets by year-end 2029. These actions will now be embedded within the in- scope motor retail portfolios, with year-on-year results tracked against plan. The plans provided for each year show a clear roadmap to 2029, highlighting that the achievement of our targets is currently on-track.

emission business models. For further information on FRSI, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS policies.

The table below shows GHG emissions from our proprietary investment portfolio mapped to Scope 1, 2, and 3 according to ESRS requirements. Previously, the emissions from so-called on balance real assets held for proprietary investments, such as real estate and infrastructure, have been accounted for in category 15. These are now shown in Scope 1 and 2, as well as in Scope 3 category 13 for real estate. More details on the methodology, assumptions, and scope of these metrics can be found in the section Methodology information for climate metrics.




GHG emissions of our proprietary investment portfolio For our proprietary investment portfolio, we calculate financed GHG emissions generally according to PCAF guidance1. We aspire to calculate GHG emissions for as much of our portfolio as possible and aim to progressively expand the coverage of our portfolio over time; currently, we are constrained by the availability of methodologies and data. Therefore, we are working on developing methods, for instance through our membership in the UN-convened NZAOA, and us co- leading the PCAF Working Group on developing a carbon accounting standard for sub-sovereign debt and strongly contributing to the PCAF Inventory Fluctuations Working Group.

To increase long-term return, delivering on our net-zero transition plan, the Allianz Group has set a strategy for reducing emissions within our proprietary investment portfolio, with intermediate targets for 2030. The strategy is governed by the FRSI. For our corporates portfolio, we are targeting a 50 % reduction of gross financed emissions intensity by 2030 against a 2019 baseline; for our listed corporates portfolio, we target a 50 % reduction in absolute financed emissions. Both are supported by engaging investee companies to drive decarbonization, steering our portfolio composition, which also includes restricting fossil fuel business, aligning high-emitting sectors with net-zero benchmarks, and investing in low-carbon solutions. For our real estate (equity and debt) portfolio, we aim to align with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor 1.5 °C pathways to achieve our 2030 targets. Strategic actions include monitoring energy performance, refurbishment of our assets, engagements with tenants, and changes in our portfolio. Progress is regularly monitored and reported, ensuring we remain on track to meet our ambitious targets.

### END TABLE 


To date, we do not calculate financed emissions for covered bonds, ABS/MBS, and cash as there is no methodology available for these asset classes. These asset classes are therefore part of the “no methodology” group in the table “Proprietary investments GHG emissions – split per asset class.” We calculate three types of financed GHG emissions defined by the underlying investment:

Policies related to climate change mitigation for our proprietary investment portfolio As outlined in the section Sustainability integration, the Allianz Group has adopted the Allianz Functional Rule for Sustainability in Investments (FRSI) to set the rules, principles, and processes that govern the integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance topics into the investment management function.

− Corporates, which includes all investees with a balance sheet, i.e., – in PCAF terminology – listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and non-listed equity, project finance, as well as funds; and

investments, commercial real estate loans, and retail mortgages, as well as funds; and

The processes described therein address climate change mitigation aspects, broken down by addressing impacts, risks and opportunities: during the selection and monitoring of asset managers, climate change aspects are considered. GHG emissions are one key trigger point for action in our Adverse Impact Steering process. In our engagements, climate change is one of the core topics, and as described in sections Sustainability strategy and governance and Active engagements, we have set climate-specific targets for engagement actions. In sustainable investments, climate change mitigation is one of the most common areas of investment. Finally, our restrictions include the fossil fuel guidelines, which address high-

− Public Debt, which includes sovereign debt, sub-sovereign debt, and supranational debt. As there is no specific PCAF guidance on carbon accounting for sub-sovereigns and supra-nationals, we have adapted the methodology for sovereign debt to these two asset classes.

By the end of 2024, our total Proprietary GHG emissions were 49 mn t CO2e, compared to 57 mn t CO2e at the end of last year. 2023 figures have been re-stated due to the new emission split and as we onboarded the retail mortgage portfolio of Allianz Leben as well as the direct real estate portfolio of Allianz Switzerland. The emissions from real estate assets in own use by the Allianz Group are disclosed in the section GHG emissions of Allianz Own Operations.

With these three groups, we cover 64 % of our total proprietary investments book value with emission data, as per the table Proprietary investments GHG emissions – financial reporting view. For the remainder, there is currently a lack of emission methodologies or data.

1_PCAF stands for Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials. Our targets are displayed as CO2 equivalents but refer to all Kyoto GHGs. The actual inclusion of non-CO2 gases depends on the investee

data as made available to us by our data providers. Our detailed GHG accounting method is covered in the section Methodology information for climate metrics.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Our Scope 1 emissions from on balance real assets decreased mainly through reductions in our portfolio managed by PPRE, which more than offset the increase in data coverage and hence emissions. increased data Scope 2 emissions coverage; it should be noted that for a part of the real estate portfolio without market-based data, location-based data has been used, which are typically higher.

The tables below show the book value, financed GHG emissions, and coverage (i.e., percentage of book value for which financed GHG emissions are available) in two different asset class splits, incl. IFRS 9 asset classes.

Overall our coverage with emission data improved in 2024. Since some of the assets which were previously in the bucket “No methodology yet” are now covered in Corporates and Real Estate, the individual coverage figure for that bucket can be lower if not all assets of the sub-part of the portfolio are yet covered, such as for the retail mortgage portfolio of Allianz Leben or Corporate funds. Funds investing into corporates were not in scope previously. These funds were previously mapped under a "no methodology" classification. Since the emission coverage for these is at around 20 %, the overall coverage for all corporates drops.

The decrease in financed emissions of listed corporates and all corporates’ emission intensity is mainly driven by reallocation, in particular reduction of weight of higher-emitting investees and divestments. The reduction in public debt financed emissions is mainly due to decreased scope 1 emissions in developed countries like Germany, France, and Italy. Further, the underlying emissions database was updated 1. Additionally, many countries saw an increase in PPP- adjusted GDP from the World Bank's latest data, which also revised and increased previous years' figures. Further details on the corporates portfolio changes year-on-year are provided the section Decarbonization levers and actions below.

Our Scope 3 category 15 emissions currently only include Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our corporate investees. Given the uncertainty about Scope 3 data for the corporates portfolio, we estimate that these financed emissions amount to between 87 mn and 161 mn t CO2e. This wide range is due to the current underreporting of Scope 3 emissions and significant variations in estimations by data providers. We are committed to closely monitoring this topic while further developing our reporting capability to enhance our disclosure.

1_The emissions of these assets are not shown in this table under Scope 3 Cat 15 but in the table "Proprietary investments GHG emissions (Scope 1-3) - TOTAL." These assets are also excluded from the calculation of coverage. 2023 figures are restated accordingly. 2_In 2024, the carbon intensity methodology was revised to align with the latest PCAF guidance. Previously, the methodology adhered to the calculation approach outlined in the SFDR RTS, published on 6 April 2022, where carbon intensity was determined by dividing absolute financed emissions by the total value of all investments. The updated methodology now calculates carbon intensity by dividing absolute financed emissions by the value of only those investments for which financed emissions are calculated. As a result, carbon intensities have increased significantly in asset classes with low emission data coverage.

Targets related to climate change mitigation for our proprietary investment portfolio We deem the framework of the NZAOA Target-Setting Protocol (TSP) as best practice for setting GHG emission reduction targets. The TSP was developed with a strong reference to IPCC’s climate scenarios1, limiting temperature increase by the end of the century to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot during the century. The TSP was aligned with relevant stakeholders, including academia, and vetted in a public consultation.

Assuming a static portfolio and emission data coverage of non- listed investees increasing to reach 80 % by 2030, our intensity target for listed and non-listed corporates would correspond to associated absolute GHG emissions of 19.2 mn tCO2e for year-end 2029. For our real estate portfolio, our intensity target would correspond to associated absolute emissions of 0.2 mn tCO2e for year-end 2029. These figures are an illustrative view rather than an accurate representation of the expected absolute emissions in the target year and will change due to our dynamic portfolio.

intermediate 2030 decarbonization targets for corporates and real estate as well as the respective status versus baseline year values, where available. All emissions targets are well on track, with the absolute financed emissions of our listed corporate portfolio now reduced by 50.7 %. The significant reduction in real estate carbon intensity from 33.5 kg CO2e/m2 to 21.0 kg CO2e/m2 is also driven by an improvement of data availability (moving from estimates to actual data as well as adding real estate funds to the reporting) and allocation changes, in particular, the sale of buildings. With the improving data coverage for specific types of real estate investments, a new mix of CRREM pathways applies, with the resulting overall carbon intensity target value for real estate for year-end 2029 now being ca. 20 kg CO2e/m2 versus ca. 25 previously. We expect the resulting intensity target value from CRREM pathways to continue to change with increasing data coverage.

for our intermediate decarbonization targets. It should be noted that while the NZAOA TSP defines targets for engagements, sectors, and low- carbon solutions, we display these as actions in line with regulatory definitions in ESRS E1.

Analysis on the contribution of the different decarbonization levers for the Corporates and directly held Real Estate portfolios can be found in the respective tables below.

Our progress toward target achievement will be monitored regularly and reported in the Sustainability Statement.

When setting these targets, we considered potential future developments in large industries, especially the E.U. and the U.S., based on the latest climate laws and regulations.

1_Both corporate targets exclude investments which qualify for the Allianz Steel and Cement Climate List. The current year book value of those investments is € 59.59 mn and the current year financed emissions are 16.64 k t CO2e. 2_Including our proprietary portfolio managed by PPRE and the direct portfolio of Allianz Switzerland. Therefore covers debt and equity investments and real estate assets held for investment purposes as per IFRS 9 categories. Real Estate investments which are in own use by Allianz are managed against the targets disclosed in the section Targets related to climate change mitigation in own operations.

3_50 % of real estate funds and 60 % of commercial mortgages where reported emissions are available are currently covered by this target. Retail mortgages are not in scope yet. 4_Target 2030: Exact target depends on regional and sectorial portfolio composition.

A GHG emission reduction of 50 % during this decade is in line with the latest IPCC scenarios and equal to the midpoint of the respective scenario range from 40 % to 60 % suggested by the NZAOA, after thorough analysis of the IPCC scenarios and vetting with academia1. For our sub-portfolio targets, we have used the C1a and C1b scenarios provided by the IPCC and run sensitivity analysis on both required and potential emission pathways with the World Energy Outlook scenarios by the IEA and the Forecast Policy Scenario by Inevitable Policy Response.

Corporates We have set a reduction target for absolute gross financed GHG emissions for listed corporates (corporate bonds and listed equity). Our target is to reduce absolute financed emissions in the respective asset classes by 50 % by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline emissions. We had chosen 2019 as our base year when setting targets in 2023 as it is the first year with good data coverage and quality; in addition, year-end 2019 data is not influenced by COVID-19 or other extraordinary events.

“Real Estate” includes the fully consolidated investments not in own use by Allianz Group. The emissions of those investments were shown separately under “on balance real assets” with their respective Scope 1, 2, and Scope 3 category 13 emissions in the table Proprietary investments GHG emissions (Scope 1–3) - TOTAL. These assets are subject to the same target as the other real estate investments which are not fully consolidated. Fully consolidated real estate investments which are in own use by Allianz Group are managed against the targets disclosed in the section Targets related to climate change mitigation for Allianz Own Operations.

For both our listed and non-listed corporate exposure, we have set a target to reduce our gross emission intensity by 50 % by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline emission intensity (see table above). For non-listed corporates, we are still in the process of gathering emission data and we do not know beforehand how many of our portfolio companies and indirect investments via funds will deliver data in the coming years until 2030. As data coverage is uncertain and changing, we cannot set a reasonable absolute financed emission reduction target for our non-listed corporate portfolio yet. An intensity metric does not rely on coverage, as absolute emissions are divided by the respective covered portfolio exposure.

We aim to finance the transition of companies in the hard-to- abate cement and steel sector that are aligned with a 1.5 °C path and have well-defined decarbonization strategies. We therefore created a separate emission bucket for new investments in those companies 2 on our “steel and cement climate list,” meaning that the financed emissions of these new investments are shown separately in the emissions table under “No target yet” and are not part of the 2030 corporate sub-portfolio emission target. For more information on this, please refer to the Explanatory Notes on the Allianz company website.

“No methodology for carbon accounting” refers to parts of the portfolio for which we do not have any emission data due to a lack of accounting methods. “No target yet” relates to the parts of the portfolio for which targets have not been set, e.g., due to a lack of commonly accepted target-setting methodologies, or which are exempt from our targets like the steel and cement climate list (see section below).

Second, we want to participate in at least 15 multilateral engagements on climate (30 multilateral engagements overall), either as the lead investor or as a supporting member. To reach this target, we are continuing to review existing or new multilateral engagement initiatives for ones that meet our ambition and are aligned with our interests.

Real Estate For our real estate portfolio, we have set 2030 intensity targets that are aligned with the second version of the CRREM. These sectoral decarbonization pathways are based on the latest science and widely accepted as best practice. The targets have been developed with external stakeholders such as property managers or joint venture partners. Our real estate targets are also aligned with the NZAOA TSP. They include all operational emissions from the entire building irrespective of the organizational boundaries or control approaches (“whole-building approach”). Because of tenant-related operational emissions are in scope. Based on 2023 GHG emissions data, the current GHG performance trend is in line with the CRREM decarbonization pathways at a portfolio level.

Investee company decarbonization – engagements on net-zero transition The ways in which we can support the reduction of GHG emissions from our investee companies and real estate investments depend on the respective ownership structure. For example, in the case of fully-owned real estate assets, we can directly support GHG emissions reductions by making deep refurbishments. However, if we are a minority owner, as is the case in most of our public equity holdings, we may use more indirect measures to support GHG emissions reductions through engagement.

Third, of our top 100 portfolio emitters currently not already adequately engaged multilaterally or by our asset managers, we aim to engage bilaterally with 15. We will screen the financed GHG emissions of our portfolio companies to identify those qualifying for engagement, i.e., those with the highest financed GHG emissions that are not already engaged. As many of our high emitters in the portfolio can only decarbonize properly if the sector – including the value chain – has the right technology and economic incentives to do so, we are supportive of high-quality sector engagement initiatives. Sector engagements support our sector targets for 2030, particularly in the steel and oil & gas sectors, as described in the following paragraphs.

Therefore, one action to reach our 2030 GHG emission reduction targets is our continued engagement and support of our portfolio companies to jointly work with the portfolio companies on decarbonization strategies and targets as well as the respective alignment of capital expenditures and corporate lobbying. We have consequently implemented a systematic engagement approach that includes multiple types of engagements:

Decarbonization levers and actions related to climate change mitigation for our proprietary investment portfolio For our portfolio targets, there are generally two levers for reducing GHG emissions: either the assets (i.e., our portfolio companies or our real estate investments) reduce their GHG emissions (investee company decarbonization), or we change the composition of our portfolio over time (portfolio steering). To this end, we have different actions in place to support emission reductions.

The progress against our engagement targets can be found in the subsection Active section Sustainability Engagements. integration in the

− bilateral (between us and the investee company), − multilateral (through initiatives like CA100+), − and asset manager (between us and the asset managers that

manage our portfolios) 2.

Portfolio steering Our investment management function allows us to steer our portfolio allocation by setting targets and frameworks for our asset managers. These include defining detailed decarbonization targets for individual mandates, restricting certain high-emitting companies without reduction plans, and increasing target volumes for investments in low- carbon solutions. We break down our global targets to an individual mandate level. Each asset manager is then responsible for reaching the respective mandate decarbonization target by taking appropriate actions. We hold regular deep dive meetings where we monitor and discuss the decarbonization performance of our asset managers against the set targets.

Corporates For our corporate portfolio, we have set the following four targets on actions to pull the two decarbonization levers. These actions relate partially to addressing risks and opportunities, in addition to our inside-out impact:

We have set three engagement targets for our corporate portfolio.

First, by 2030, we plan to engage with all external asset managers who are “below expectations” based on our in-house systematic assessment. This assessment differs based on the type of asset manager and asset class. If an asset manager does not meet our minimum expectations, we start the engagement process to understand the root cause of the asset manager not meeting our expectations and develop a plan of action for them to close the identified gaps that persist. For all public equity asset managers, we benchmark them against best practice guidance (e.g., NZAOA guidance on best practice for proxy voting and climate policy engagement). In situations where engagement does not lead to the desired results, the asset manager may become ineligible for new business. For more information on this, please refer to Our Engagement Approach on the Allianz company website.

− Engage high-emitting companies in our portfolio to increase our

positive impact and reduce risks; Invest € 20 bn in low-carbon solutions to increase our positive impact and seize opportunities;

−

The scope of the actions outlined below to implement portfolio allocation changes is in line with the scope of our overall GHG emission reduction targets, i.e., covering our global exposure in corporates and real estate.

− Align specific high-emitting sectors (oil and gas, utilities (coal), and steel1) with IEA Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario to reduce negative impact and risks in our portfolio;

− Restrict fossil fuel-related business models in a targeted manner to reduce our risk and negative impact.

1_In 2023, we also disclosed a sector target for automobiles. However, it is not considered an action relating to the overarching emission targets as it focuses on Scope 3 emissions of investees, whereas the portfolio

target covers Scope 1 and 2 emissions of investees. Therefore, we have decided to remove this target overall and not report it in the Sustainability Statement going forward.

2_For further information on our engagement approach, please refer to our 2023 – Allianz Investment Management – Our Engagement Approach on the Allianz company website. For stewardship expectations for asset managers, see for instance the respective NZAOA guidance.

The table above shows the additionally divested equity related to the energy guidelines in 2024. As fixed-income investments of restricted companies are put into run-off, we show here for the first time the total outstanding amount in run-off. The 1 January 2025, milestone for the Group Oil and Gas restriction was largely anticipated already by the end of 2024, leading to a significant increase in the divestment of equities and the run-off of fixed-income assets related to oil and gas during 2024.

1_Coverage as per Transition Pathway Initiative universe and metrics. 2_As outlined in the inaugural transition plan, we have set a sector target for automobiles. However, this target covers Scope 3 (cat 11) emissions only and does therefore not directly contribute to our emission reduction target. Hence, we do not pursue this target further.

3_We have updated our 2030 target values to the 2028 Transition Pathway Initiative benchmark values, which are appropriate as they reflect the one year time lag in our emission data.

Restrictions Second, we restrict certain companies in line with our global energy- related guidelines for thermal coal, oil sands, and oil & gas. For further information, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS policies. These restrictions also contribute to the implementation of our sector targets for oil & gas and utilities. All restricted companies are included in the Allianz Group Risk Global Restricted (GRGR) List and are shared with all asset managers on a regular basis. Asset managers are obliged to comply with these restrictions.

Further portfolio changes Third, we have further portfolio changes, which include portfolio re- allocations as well as other factors such as changes in the company enterprise value. A further measure under “further portfolio changes” are the targets we have set for the high-emitting sectors of oil & gas, utilities, and steel:

Also, these targets build on the recommendations of the NZAOA TSP. They further incorporate potential and expected public and private policy developments which would close the gap towards the net-zero scenario.

The targets trigger three types of actions: sector engagements, restrictions, and moving from climate laggards to climate leaders within the respective sectors.

While the reductions achieved in 2024 are presented as exact percentage figures, they are best estimates taking into account potential overlaps. The expected contributions until 2030 indicate a potential outcome, not a forecast, and are hence shown as a range. This table refers to our absolute emission reduction target for listed corporates. We also expect similar contributions for our intensity target for corporates. We do not estimate reduction contributions for parts of the portfolio with no targets as per table Proprietary investments GHG emission targets.

Real Estate

Real economy decarbonization

Our action under the real economy decarbonization lever is tenant engagement, as described below.

With the progress achieved in 2024, our overall emission intensity reduction target is already matched, with 50.7 % reduction achieved against the target of 50 %. This gives us a buffer to react in the coming years, in case some underlying trends do not continue as expected. In the past year, reduction has been spread relatively evenly across all actions, with portfolio changes having the most impact, followed by emission reductions of our investee companies.

For the remaining period until year-end 2029, we expect reduction effects of between zero and five percent for the four actions. Of these, emission reductions of our investees contribute most. If all of these were to materialize, we would over-achieve our target. There will be a further impact from changes in the attribution factor (i.e. denominator changes of the investees, that is Enterprise Value incl.

Tenant engagement

For assets which are not fully consolidated, engaging tenants in areas like renewable electricity use and the general decarbonization of the power and heat grid will aid emission reductions.

Portfolio steering

We have two actions in place under the portfolio steering lever, which are described below.

For fully consolidated real estate assets, we focus on monitoring energy performance (e.g., via smart meters) and measures related to energy efficiency (e.g., energy audits, predictive technologies to

New acquisitions and sales

For our real estate investments 2, we steer our portfolio toward the target by acquiring real estate aligned with the 1.5 °C pathways and selling investments which are not aligned, as our acquisitions and sales analysis incorporates relevant sustainability factors such as GHG emissions and energy performance standards. If requirements are not met, related Capex needs to be considered in the business plans for all new directly held and joint venture acquisitions.

The table below shows the contributions of the actions to the absolute GHG emission reductions in our real estate assets portfolio in 2024 as well as the further expected reductions from 2025 through to the end of 2029. All figures are presented as percentage changes in emissions intensity in line with our target. The lower ranges in the table reflect maximum decarbonization effort and the upper ranges reflect minimum decarbonization effort.

As active managers with proven research capabilities, AllianzGI and PIMCO continue to develop tailored investment solutions for customers who have elected to implement sustainability-related investment objectives or criteria. Both asset managers cater to a wide range of investors with bespoke needs – from retail fund investors to institutional customers. They also take an active role in dialogue within industry and market initiatives.

In our directly held real estate portfolio, the emission intensity fell by 8 %. This was driven by a variety of actions, most notably by renewable energy use in landlord-controlled building areas as well as energy efficiency improvements. It should be noted that the overall real estate emission intensity fell stronger than the one from the directly held portfolio, due to effects described above in the section Targets related to climate change mitigation for our proprietary investment portfolio. Our future emissions reduction strategy relies to a significant extent on the decarbonization of energy grids as well as our of tenant- controlled emissions. This lever as well as the actions under our direct control generally point in the right direction and we are on track to achieve our long-term goals, in line with our CRREM target. We are implementing measures, such as energy efficiency upgrades, renewable energy adoption, tenant engagement programs, and pursuing green building certifications.



To mitigate climate change in our third-party asset management, AllianzGI has implemented a Climate Policy Statement across all third- party assets, integrating sustainability risks, offering climate-focused products, and engaging in stewardship activities like engagement and proxy voting. AllianzGI also offers climate thematic and impact-driven funds, such as green bonds and renewable energy equity. Our other asset manager, PIMCO, while adhering to fiduciary duties and customer guidelines, also incorporates sustainability risks into their investment decisions, but does not have a specific policy as defined under ESRS in place. Neither asset manager has implemented actions or targets as defined under ESRS.

With regards to the investment and management of third-party funds, AllianzGI and PIMCO must comply with their fiduciary duties. They therefore follow the requirements, values, and risk appetite of their customers and do not set own outcome-oriented targets or actions as defined under ESRS.

Policies related to climate change mitigation for our asset management1 The Climate Policy Statement outlines AllianzGI's climate strategy, integrating both climate risks and defining opportunities into investment decisions. AllianzGI’s climate policy aims to integrate risk mitigation into daily investment operations while exploring opportunities to enhance asset value and market positioning, acknowledging that climate change is a critical issue for all stakeholders. AllianzGI’s approach to climate-related risks and opportunities is based on the understanding that they could have significant financial implications, recognizing that these factors may increasingly affect the value of clients’ portfolios over time. At AllianzGI, climate change is never considered in isolation but is combined with the other sustainability pillars, planetary boundaries, and inclusive capitalism to create a comprehensive sustainability approach.

Policies related to climate change mitigation for Allianz Own Operations Allianz Group has adopted for Sustainable Operations (FRSO) to address the material adverse impacts and risks on climate from our own operations. Our climate impacts are primarily driven by GHG emissions associated with our energy usage, fleet, and business travel.

Integrating climate considerations into the investment process is achieved through AllianzGI’s sustainability risk management policy and exclusion policy. The sustainability risk management process involves assessing external sustainability research data and/or internal research and analysis. AllianzGI conducts scenario analysis to assess the impact of climate-related risks at entity level. The sustainable investment experts in risklab, the advisory and solutions unit, provide advisory services to clients to help with portfolio decarbonization and climate risk considerations in their investment strategy.

Our policy focuses on climate change mitigation, particularly on reducing GHG emissions. We achieve this through principles of energy efficiency, renewable electricity, sustainable heating and cooling and initiatives such as transitioning to a green fleet and optimizing air travel. We are committed to sourcing 100 % renewable electricity and plan on transitioning to sustainable heating and cooling technologies. Additionally, we are transitioning Allianz’s own fleet to a 100 % green fleet by year-end 2030.

While PIMCO has policy statements on sustainability-related topics, these are not considered policies as defined under ESRS as they do not link to material sustainability IROs (in many cases existing policy statements pre-date the double materiality assessment). They do not reference objectives or targets, or contain action plans as defined under ESRS, and are not included in PIMCO’s governance rules. As a fiduciary, PIMCO manages its customer assets in accordance with the customer’s investment guidelines and objectives. These guidelines are expressed investment management agreement, prospectus, or other foundational documents.

The implementation of the FRSO is monitored regularly, and actual performance is reported for energy, air travel, and car fleet metrics. Additionally, the implementation is assessed via annual bilateral assessments with subsidiaries. For further information on FRSO, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS policies.

AllianzGI’s climate change policy statement is applicable to listed equities, listed corporate fixed-income, and private markets assets managed by AllianzGI.

AllianzGI has a Sustainability Governance Committee (SGC) with representatives from relevant internal functions, serving as the central sustainability governance and decision-making body which approved the Climate Policy Statement. The SGC reports to the AllianzGI Executive Committee and the AllianzGI Legal, Compliance, and Risk Committee, overseeing all overarching sustainability-related topics, including climate change. The relevant internal functions at AllianzGI hold ultimate responsibility for implementing the Climate Policy Statement.

Note that different jurisdictions and regulatory environments of asset managers may influence their level of market disclosure in light of regional factors and the respective regulatory approach of jurisdictions.

The disclosed Scope 3 categories as well as the scope of our targets for own operations are not yet considering the results of the Scope 3 significance analysis. The corresponding changes for our disclosure of Scope 3 categories as well as our own operations targets will be considered for 2025 onwards.

Climate change mitigation for Allianz Own Operations



AllianzGI supports climate ambitions through sustainability research, stewardship, the integration of climate considerations in the investment process, the offering of dedicated sustainability strategies, and climate scenario analysis.

To deliver on our net-zero transition plan, the Allianz Group has set a strategy for mitigating climate change in our own operations, with 2030 intermediate targets (i.e. by year-end 2029). The approach is governed by the Allianz Functional Rule for Sustainable Operations. Our 2030 target is a 65 % reduction in GHG emission intensity per employee against a 2019 baseline, through actions such as sourcing 100 % renewable electricity, transitioning to a green fleet, and reducing GHG emissions from business travel (excl. fleet). Progress is regularly monitored and reported, ensuring we remain on track to meet our ambitious targets.

The Sustainability research team at AllianzGI conducts thematic, sector, and company research to identify, monitor, and analyze the most relevant sustainability issues. The Stewardship team engages in both engagement and proxy voting related also to climate change, seeking to understand how companies are addressing climate change. The Stewardship team is additionally responsible for exercising voting rights at shareholder meetings as part of AllianzGI’s fiduciary responsibility.

For more information on the methodology used to calculate Allianz Own Operations GHG emissions, please refer to the section Methodology information for climate metrics.

The total GHG emissions per employee arising from Allianz Own Operations were 924.1 kg CO2e for the twelve months ended 31 December 2024. Of that, 230.9 kg CO2e results from Scope 1; 38.0 kg CO2e from Scope 2; and 655.3 kg CO2e from Scope 3. Scope 3

emissions include categories 1, 3, 6, and 7, covering fuel and energy- related emissions, business travel, remote working, public cloud, and paper use. Disclosure of significant categories of Scope 3 emissions may be adjusted from 2025 onwards based on the results of the significance analysis. The current results of the Scope 3 significance analysis can be found in the table GHG Scope 3 inventory. Scope 3 GHG financed emissions which fall under category 15 are covered

under Proprietary Investments and are therefore not within the scope of own operations.

Total own operations GHG emissions per employee have slightly increased compared to 2023. This has been driven by increased business travel activities compared to previous years, as well as external effects (e.g. increased Scope 3 energy emission factors).

Targets related to climate change mitigation for Allianz Own Operations

Overarching GHG reduction target(s) In our Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan (INZTP), published in September 2023, we set GHG emission intensity reduction targets for year-end 2025, 2029, and 2030 of 50 %, 65 %, and 70 % respectively, using 2019 as the baseline. Since we have already exceeded the interim year-end 2025 target in past years, and to ensure consistency across the Allianz Group business functions, we are now focusing on the 2030 target (i.e. year-end 2029). The 2030 target aims to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 65 % across Scope 1, Scope 2, and selected Scope 3 emissions (see section GHG emissions of Allianz Own Operations). The decarbonization and removal targets for Allianz Own Operations remain as stated in the INZTP.

Assuming a static headcount, our 2030 target would correspond to associated absolute GHG emissions of 129.7 kt CO2e (2030 intensity target * estimated headcount). These figures are an illustrative view rather than an accurate representation of the expected absolute

emissions in the target year; the current headcount was used as an estimate because we expect that new hires and leavers will broadly offset each other and therefore any net impact is not expected to be material.

The targets for Allianz Own Operations are defined on the basis of data from fully consolidated entities where the Allianz Group employees, as defined under “Contracted Headcount” are operating. Environmental data is based on measurements or calculations where possible. The target was defined in alignment with the latest climate science. The progress towards our 2030 target is published on a yearly basis as part of our annual reporting cycles. In the twelve months ended 31 December 2024, we made progress by reducing our GHG emissions by 62 % 1 per employee compared to our 2019 baseline.

When setting targets for own operations emissions, Allianz considered a wide range of potential future developments. For Scope 1 and 3, Allianz factors in the general market shift to a decarbonized mobility, such as transforming its own fleet to a green fleet portfolio and the deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. For

Scope 3, Allianz expects an increasing level of digitalization, which will lead to less use of paper and greater use of cloud services.

The combined GHG emission intensity reduction target of 65 % is anchored to and governed by the FRSO. The FRSO ensures the achievement of the Renewable Electricity, Energy Efficiency, Green Fleet, and the Business Travel (excl. fleet) targets. The GHG emission intensity reduction target of 65 % for 2030 versus 2019 baseline includes Allianz Own Operations’ activities in Scope 1, 2, and selected Scope 3 activities as it is an overall reduction target. All the targets governed by the FRSO are Group targets, including data from all Allianz Group subsidiaries and global lines within the environmental reporting scope. The main stakeholders involved in setting the targets were the Allianz Group Centers, such as Group Sustainable Operations, Group Accounting & Reporting, and Global Sustainability, through the establishment of a working group to jointly design the targets, set our ambition level, and ensure compliance. The Group Sustainability Board advised on the targets. Delivery against the targets is monitored regularly and formally assessed at mid-year and year-end. The progress as of year-end 2024 is in line with our plan to

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

achieve the 2030 target, which is supported by ongoing or planned actions.

The breakdown of our GHG emissions reduction target by Scopes is as follows. For Scope 1, Allianz Own Operations plans to reduce emissions per employee by 66 % by 2030, and for Scope 2, we plan to reduce emissions per employee by 89 % by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline. Both targets are in line with the science-based-aligned minimum linear reduction rate for Scope 1 and 2 to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. For Scope 3, our target is to reduce emissions per employee by 42 % by 2030, compared to a 2019 baseline. The table below shows how each action contributes to the targets for the different scopes.

Decarbonization levers and actions related to climate change mitigation for Allianz own operations There are three main decarbonization levers for our own operations: renewable energy, energy efficiency, and green mobility. Some emission sources are not covered by an action or target and thus a decarbonization lever, such as rental cars, rail travel, private car use for business purposes, and others. Each action is covered by a separate target, although some targets cover multiple actions at once. In addition, all actions are covered by the overall GHG emission reduction target for own operations.

The travel target of a GHG emission reduction of 40 % per employee by year-end 2025 against a 2019 baseline as disclosed in the Allianz Annual Report 2023 was redefined into two targets: Green Fleet and Business Travel (excl. fleet). This reflects Allianz’s ambition to transition to a green fleet while separately addressing GHG emissions from business travel (excl. fleet).

Renewable electricity Renewable electricity is the only action within the decarbonization lever of renewable energy. The action is covered by the Renewable Electricity target. As a signatory of the RE100 initiative, we have committed to sourcing 100 % renewable electricity 1 for our Group-wide office buildings and data centers. RE100 is a global initiative bringing together businesses committed to 100 % renewable electricity. In setting its targets, Allianz considered a wide range of potential future developments. The Renewable Electricity target includes Allianz Own

Operations’ activities in Scope 2 and 3. The target has been achieved as of 2023 by implementing the action renewable electricity to shift the electricity portfolio toward 100 % renewable sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro). The action encompasses all office buildings and data centers worldwide that are either owned or leased by the Allianz Group (i.e., all buildings in which the Allianz Group employees are located) within the environmental reporting scope.

Appropriate procedures for continuing to source renewable electricity are established in the respective locations.

Reduction of heating energy consumption Reduction of heating energy consumption is one of two actions within the decarbonization lever of energy efficiency. Both actions are covered by the Energy Efficiency target. The 2030 target is an energy consumption reduction in office buildings of 50 % per employee compared to a 2019 baseline. In setting its targets, Allianz considered a wide range of potential future developments. After a significant reduction since 2019, Allianz factors in a slower but steady reduction in energy consumption at its office sites. This is achieved by moving to or building new energy-efficient office buildings as well as retrofitting existing office buildings to the latest energy efficiency standards, in addition to providing training for employees about energy-saving practices. The Energy Efficiency target includes Allianz Own Operations’ activities in Scope 1, 2, and 3. The progress as of 2024 is in line with our plan to achieve the 2030 target. To deliver on the target, Allianz will continue to implement the action reduction of heating energy consumption. The action encompasses all office buildings worldwide that are either owned or leased by Allianz (i.e., all buildings in which Allianz employees are located) within the environmental reporting scope. Appropriate procedures for reductions of heating energy consumption are established in the respective locations.

2_Green vehicles currently consist of battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Exceptions might be granted in the future for plug-in hybrid vehicles for example in regions with insufficient charging infrastructure.

Reduction of electricity consumption Reduction of electricity consumption is one of two actions within the decarbonization lever of energy efficiency. Both actions are covered by the Energy Efficiency target. To deliver against the 2030 target, Allianz will continue to implement the action reduction of electricity consumption. The action encompasses all office buildings worldwide that are either owned or leased by Allianz (i.e., all buildings in which Allianz employees are located) within the environmental reporting scope. Appropriate procedures reductions of electricity consumption are established in the respective locations.

### END TABLE 


In 2024, energy consumption per employee in our office buildings was reduced by nearly 50 % compared to the 2019 baseline, primarily due to a decrease in electricity consumption while heating consumption remained almost stable.

Green fleet Transitioning to a green fleet is one of two actions within the decarbonization lever of green mobility. The action is covered by the Green Fleet target. The Green Fleet 2030 target is an 85 % share of green vehicles 2 in the Allianz global fleet. As a signatory of the EV100 initiative, the Allianz Group has committed to fully transitioning the company fleet to the EV100 standards by year-end 2030 at the latest. EV100 is a global initiative accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. In setting its targets, Allianz considered a wide range of potential future developments, such as the general market shift toward decarbonized mobility. A slower than anticipated increase in the necessary infrastructure (e.g., charging stations) may affect the target. The Green Fleet target includes Allianz Own Operations’ activities in Scope 1, 2, and 3. The progress as of 2024 is in line to achieve our 2030 target.

range of potential future developments. After a significant reduction since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Allianz expects a rapid increase in the supply and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as fuel with lower emission intensity to further reduce GHG emissions from air travel within the technical constraints of SAF. The Business Travel (excl. fleet) GHG intensity reduction target includes Allianz Own Operations’ activities in Scope 3. Our progress is in line with our plan to achieve the 2030 target.

To deliver on the target, Allianz Group has implemented the green fleet action to transition its own car fleet to green vehicles. The action encompasses all fleet vehicles worldwide that are either owned or leased by the Allianz Group within the environmental reporting scope excluding assistance vehicles 1. Appropriate procedures to transition the Allianz Group global fleet to green vehicles are and will be established in the respective locations.

To deliver on the target, Allianz has implemented the air travel optimization action to specifically reduce and address emissions from air travel. The action covers all Allianz employees within the scope of environmental reporting. Air travel optimization also covers the usage of SAF. Our quality requirements at Allianz Group for sourcing SAF are extensive and include aspects such as full lifecycle emission coverage, transparency on details such as location and production pathways, as well as third-party assurance of the certificates from our providers prior to delivery. We are aware that SAF is still a dynamic topic and that there are many initiatives currently developing official registries for a book-and-claim approach. The Allianz Group is monitoring the developments closely.

Actions relating to climate change adaptation for our insurance portfolio We have defined a number of actions for climate change adaptation to enable us to carry out insurance activities in a responsible manner. These actions relate to managing the risks associated with climate change adaptation, to which both Allianz and its customers are exposed.

The reflect expected maximum table decarbonization effort and the upper ranges reflect minimum decarbonization effort.

accumulation, requirements. including guidance on limits and minimum

Another key principle of the ASU is understanding risk and exposure. This principle is essential to successful underwriting but also enables us to understand our exposure to emerging climate change risks and manage the risks associated with climate change adaptation.

In 2024, the increase from the renewable energy lever was attributed to external factors (i.e. higher Scope 3 energy emission factors). The rise in the green mobility lever was due to higher travel emissions compared to previous years. Additionally, a decrease was observed as a result of reduced heating energy and electricity consumption.

The specific aim of sustainable insurance in building resilience is particularly relevant to climate change adaptation, as it focuses on enhancing the capacity to prepare for and recover from dangerous climate-related events. This applies both internally and externally (for example for our customers and stakeholders) and is central to many initiatives discussed in this section, such as leveraging technical excellence and managing our risk exposure.

Exposure and risk management To achieve the policy principle of understanding risk and exposure, exposure and risk management functions and tools in the subsidiaries are regularly assessed through Technical Pricing Certifications.

Looking ahead to 2030, it is expected that travel emissions will decrease. Measures are in place to monitor and reduce air travel, such as promoting digital collaboration. Furthermore, a transition to electrified mobility and a more mature SAF market are expected. In terms of energy, continued reductions in consumption are anticipated, driven by initiatives like the modernization of our office buildings.

NatCat risks are generally managed through risk pooling, and remaining peak risks are addressed through traditional retrocession or capital market solutions.

One of the key Sustainable Solutions objectives is providing incentives for risk reduction, encouraging customers to protect themselves or their assets against the adverse effects of climate change, thereby driving a positive impact on climate change adaptation. For more detail on how the Allianz Group is providing incentives for our customers’ risk reduction, please see the section Product design.

Tools specific to managing risks associated with climate change adaptation are described below.

Climate change adaptation

Climate change adaptation for our insurance portfolio

− Natural Catastrophe Modeling: In order to understand and assess Natural Catastrophe (NatCat) risks appropriately, we have set up the Allianz Center of Competence for Natural Perils at Allianz Reinsurance, consisting of including meteorologists, hydrologists, geophysicists, geographers, and mathematicians. These experts model NatCat scenarios and assess worldwide exposure to NatCat risks. Vendor and in-house applications provide a comprehensive risk profile for any defined location for the current climate, incorporating potential climate change impacts for selected scenarios, such as flooding. Models and geoinformation products (e.g., high-resolution hazard maps) also develop risk-based pricing for NatCat perils and provide portfolio managers with insights into local and regional risk accumulation. The Allianz Modeling Platform hosts all internally developed NatCat risk models, leveraging the catastrophe claims history to reflect Allianz’s risk view.

All of our actions described below contribute to the achievement of these policy objectives.




Section summary

Our strategy on climate change adaptation is guided by our objective to build resilience internally and for our customers. Governed by the ASU, our approach involves identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring climate risks and opportunities within our insurance portfolio. Although we do not have specific quantifiable targets for climate change adaptation, we leverage our technical excellence using tools such as our Natural Catastrophe Modeling and SPHERE to understand and manage risk exposure.

Targets related to climate change adaptation for our insurance portfolio Anticipating and adapting to climate change risks is a strategic focus for Allianz and it is embedded into our strategy and everyday processes. We embed climate change risk and opportunity management into our insurance business by developing and adjusting products and services, updating policies and processes, setting targets and limits, and engaging with internal and external stakeholders.

Policies related to climate change adaptation for our insurance portfolio The Allianz Standard for Underwriting stipulates that all Property- Casualty insurance business activities in the value chain must be carried out in a responsible and forward-looking way by identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks and opportunities associated with environmental, social, and governance issues.

Adaptation is at the core of our business as an insurance company. As part of this, we help businesses and customers build resilience in line with our policy objectives, for example through creating Sustainable Solutions, providing services such as risk management, risk consulting, and claims provisions which aim to build back better. For more information on our approach to building back better, please see the section Sustainable Solutions. We currently do not have specific targets for adaptation, as these services and solutions are difficult to quantify with available data.

− SPHERE: The new risk assessment solution “SPHERE” is live at more than 20 subsidiaries, enabling underwriters to make informed decisions based on exact client locations when assessing NatCat, climate change-related, and accumulation risk at the point of underwriting.

A key element of our climate change adaptation actions is performance management, and the ASU describes its fundamentals, including governance, resources required, and Group processes. It also defines the standards for identifying, monitoring, and managing risk

Technical Price (TP) System The Technical Price System, detailed in the section Sustainability integration enables Allianz to appropriately price and manage risks, including emerging climate risk and, more broadly, the risks associated with climate change adaptation. The predicted costs of natural hazards are reflected in the TP as a best estimate of total future costs, using outputs from hazard mapping, NatCat risk models, and tariff calculations to reflect the expected claims cost from natural hazards.

Product and Portfolio Management To meet the Sustainable Solutions requirements and objectives, we offer coverage for climate-related perils, where customer demands and needs require it, aiming to close the insurance gap (i.e., the gap between insurance demand and insurance coverage due to new arising climate risks). For more information on our Sustainable Solutions framework and criteria, please refer to the section E.U. Taxonomy or to the Explanatory Notes on the Allianz company website.

Risk Consulting As part of Sustainable Insurance in Property-Casualty, we engage with our large and mid-sized corporate customers through risk consulting and provide advice on matters such as preventative measures to minimize risk, including in-person support from risk engineers. The actions we have implemented to achieve this are listed below.

− Recommendations and training: For our large and mid-size corporate customers, risk consulting services are a standard part of the underwriting practice and are embedded in the client services offering. Risk consultants provide these services across all industry sectors and risks and focus on reducing the frequency and severity of claims by working with clients to understand, quantify, includes mitigate, and, eventually, recommending controls and protective actions and delivering training courses. Effective preventative measures are accounted for in the risk evaluation process. This approach provides customers with incentives to enhance their resilience and adapt to climate-related perils.

95 E1 Climate Change

− GloRiA: For retail customers and the general public, the Allianz Group developed and launched the GloRiA tool (Global Risk Assessment), which enables users to assess the risk of flood, storm, hail, wildfire, and earthquake at a user’s home location, and creates risk awareness. The tool provides checklists and explainer videos around preventative measures for homeowners. GloRiA is currently available via Allianz Versicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft in Germany.

The development and implementation of Allianz Risk Consulting is managed by AGCS, while GloRiA is managed by the Allianz Group Marketing department and the implementing subsidiaries. With GloRiA already live in the German market, we are working toward a global rollout, with the next subsidiaries being Czech Republic, Italy, and Hungary.

Climate-related risks




The Allianz Group is exposed to risks that are affected by climate change in a multitude of ways. To assess and manage climate change- related risks, we use both qualitative and quantitative strategies for climate stress testing and scenario analysis. Key risks identified for the Allianz Group include those related to proprietary investments and Property-Casualty underwriting. Stress test results based on currently available scenarios indicate that transition risks will dominate over the next 5 – 10 years, while physical risks will gradually increase. We consider the stress buffers and management actions in place to be sufficient to manage these risks.

We apply quantitative and qualitative strategies when carrying out climate stress testing and scenario analysis, considering the long-term horizons over which climate change may unfold and the high level of uncertainty over the direction of future climate and economic developments. Our objective is to foster risk awareness, build expertise in the assessment of climate change-related financial risks, test the resilience of our business and risk strategy, and inform risk management and business decision-making.

Qualitative assessments are conducted to explore to what extent and across which channels climate change risks might affect different aspects of our business, unconstrained by the still limited availability of quantitative models to fully cover all aspects of climate change across our entire business activities. These assessments are supported by the ESG risk inventory described in the section Process to identify and assess material impacts, risks, and opportunities. We deploy quantitative assessments for the indicative sizing of our exposure to climate change risks. A top-down approach is developed to assess risks at the level of our balance sheet. Complementary bottom-up modeling for the most relevant exposures provides insights into investments or climate change risks at the level of underwriting projects and may support the contextualization of results from top-down analyses.

Climate change stress testing

Results An overview of the material climate-change related risks faced by Allianz Group as identified in the ESG risk inventory is provided in the section Materiality of climate change at the beginning of the section E1 Climate Change. Those results demonstrate that the most relevant climate change risks for the Allianz Group relate to proprietary investments and Property-Casualty underwriting. Risks related to own operations and Life/Health underwriting are also present, albeit to a lesser extent.

The following section presents the results of the integrated climate change stress test as of the fourth quarter 2024. The main focus of the stress test is to provide the best estimate for own funds impacts in Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for a static balance sheet. A detailed description of the methodology is given in the subsection Quantitative assessment of climate change risks of the section Financial materiality – Risk perspective. The climate change stress test complements the qualitative assessment of climate change risks that we conducted as part of the ESG risk inventory for a subset of material and quantifiable risks, i.e., market and credit stress as well as underwriting stress in Property-Casualty insurance and in the Life/Health segment. The results of the stress test, combined with a review of possible future management actions, allow a quantitative perspective to be added to the resilience analysis presented in the Resilience Analysis in the section Materiality.

alongside observations at the individual scenario level 2. The complete analysis covers the period from now until 2050. We show here the estimated maximum adverse impacts over the 5 – 20 year period, noting that the current NGFS scenarios are primarily aimed at modeling medium- to long-term climate-economic relationships.

Two key overarching observations may be derived in terms of the aggregate market, credit, and Property-Casualty and Life/Health underwriting stress impacts. Firstly, with the exception of the “Delayed Transition” and “Fragmented World” scenarios, cumulative own funds impacts over the first 5–10 years of the projection period are largely determined by the different levels of transition risk in the scenarios, whereas impacts from physical risks are small in comparison but

increase gradually. Secondly, market and credit stress are the largest contributors to overall cumulative own funds impacts, exceeding the combined contribution from Property-Casualty and Life/Health underwriting stresses by a considerable margin.

An excerpt from the aggregated stress test results is shown in table Maximum adverse cumulative own funds impacts in NGFS/IPCC scenarios relative to a baseline scenario without climate change,1

| Net Zero 2050                    | 0.6                  | The aggressive assumptions in the “Net-Zero 2050” scenario regarding the implementation of climate policies and the pace of technological progress to limit global warming to 1.5 °C result in an initial period of strong economic pressure followed by a rapid economic recovery. Positive cumulative medium- to long-term stress impacts relative to the baseline due to lower energy prices and higher energy efficiency revert to minor losses by 2050. |
| Below 2°C                        | (2.4)                | The orderly implementation of the policy ambition of limiting global warming to below 2 °C is associated with comparatively low cumulative losses from transition risk compared to the “Net-Zero 2050” scenario. This comes at the cost of higher losses from physical risks in the long-term due to higher global warming. In particular, an overall negative trend is predicted for the second half of the century compared to the “Net-Zero 2050” scenario. |
| Delayed Transition               | (12.6)               | Very slow stress impacts materialize in initial years, followed by high cumulative own funds impacts after 2030 with the start of the delayed transition.

However, this scenario fails to effectively limit global warming, resulting in moderate losses from physical risks by 2050. Beyond this period, the “Fragmented World”, “Current Policies” and the “Nationally Determined Contributions” scenarios are expected to entail even more material losses as impacts from physical risks increase and outweigh transition risk impacts. |

Résumé du tableau :  
Le tableau présente différents scénarios climatiques et leurs impacts cumulés à long terme (5-20 ans) sur les fonds propres. Les scénarios varient en fonction de l'ambition des politiques climatiques et des progrès technologiques. Le scénario "Net Zero 2050" montre des impacts positifs à long terme grâce à une transition rapide et efficace, tandis que les scénarios "Below 2°C" et "Delayed Transition" impliquent des pertes plus importantes dues à des transitions moins ambitieuses ou retardées. Les scénarios "Nationally Determined Contributions", "Current Policies" et "Fragmented World" montrent des impacts croissants liés aux risques physiques, avec des pertes modérées à importantes à long terme.

### END TABLE 


Very low stress impacts materialize in initial years, followed by high cumulative own funds impacts after 2030 with the start of the delayed but rapid implementation of a policy ambition that is comparable to that in the "Below 2 °C scenario". The stress impacts decline only slowly until 2050 due to the sluggish economic recovery in this scenario.

In the short term, decarbonization efforts in the "Nationally Determined Contributions" scenario are similar to those in the "Below 2°C" scenario, leading to comparable impacts from transition risks. However, the absence of additional long-term policy measures implies that global warming cannot be limited to 2°C, leading to a comparatively larger increase in physical risks.

In the absence of stringent climate policy implementation, stress impacts are relatively muted, similar to the "Delayed Transition" scenario, until the second half of the time horizon where stress impacts from physical risk phase in bringing about moderate cumulative own funds impacts by 2050.

Conclusion From the quantitative perspective, the overall cumulative own funds impacts derived from the integrated climate change stress test are considered to be within Allianz’s risk tolerance, considering both the magnitude of the estimated losses and the time horizon over which they materialize, further underpinning the conclusion of the qualitative resilience analysis. This is particularly evident over the three-year planning horizon, over which the resilience of the business and risk strategy under stress conditions is considered based on a range of standardized stress scenarios not directly related to a climate change narrative. The stress scenarios assessed in the planning process include

We will continue to refine our climate change risk assessments in line with the evolving understanding of assessment methodologies and improving data availability and quality, while also accounting for a shifting climatic and political baseline.

stress levels that are comparable to or higher than the stress levels of the climate change scenarios currently used. On this basis, the planned stress buffers for the resilience of the business and risk strategy can also be considered sufficient with respect to potential losses from climate change-related stress events. A dynamic balance sheet view would further support this assessment; for example, accounting for risk mitigating management actions such as adaptation of derivatives hedging and reinsurance programs, repricing of insurance products, or the strategic repositioning of proprietary investment and insurance portfolios in line with climatic and climate policy developments. The approximate estimates we carried out on the effectiveness of selected management actions confirm this view.

1_For the purpose of the integrated climate change stress test, we estimate the own funds impacts based on the stressed MVBS excess assets over liabilities.

2_The quantitative analysis presented here further supports the fulfillment of requirements outlined in ESRS 2-SBM 3 – Material impacts, risks, and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model. It is not intended to meet requirements from E1-9 anticipated financial effects.

Climate-related opportunities




To support the net-zero transition and drive sustainable growth, the Allianz Group aims to profitably grow revenues from low-carbon technologies in commercial insurance by 150 % against a 2022 baseline, and provide additional investments of at least € 20 bn by 2030. For our motor retail insurance, we target increasing the share of Battery EVs in our portfolio within the in-scope markets by 2030. Additionally, our Sustainable Solutions framework guides product development and internal growth targets that are supportive of the transition beyond decarbonization. The associated products and business volumes undergo an internal certification process.

Policies for climate-related opportunities

The Sustainable Solutions framework is governed by the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU), as described in the sections Sustainability integration and Policies related to climate change mitigation for our insurance portfolio.

Proprietary investment in low-carbon solutions is governed by the Allianz Functional Rule for Sustainability in Investments (FRSI), as described in Sustainability integration and Allianz ESRS policies.

Targets for climate-related opportunities

For the identified opportunity relating to climate change mitigation for commercial insurance, we have set a target for gross written premium linked to low-carbon solutions. See the section Low-carbon solutions for further details.

97 E1 Climate Change

identified opportunity relating to climate change adaptation for insurance, we have not set any externally published targets. The use of the Sustainable Solutions framework has been local product development process since mandatory January 2023. In 2024, in order to accelerate the growth of Sustainable Solutions, we set internal quantitative targets for the Board of Management and CEOs of our operating insurance entities. Our insurance entities report internally on Taxonomy-aligned revenues and Sustainable Solutions-recognized revenues as a share of their total business volume. The Sustainable Solutions framework is reviewed and updated at least on a yearly basis. For the identified opportunities relating to climate change mitigation for proprietary investments, we have set a target for investment in low-carbon solutions, as described in the section Targets related to climate change mitigation for our investment portfolio.

Actions for climate-related opportunities

For insurance opportunities, there are two key actions.

The first action is the implementation of our Sustainable Solutions framework. This is described in the section Climate change adaption for our insurance portfolio, specifically relating to the action on product and portfolio management. For more information on our Sustainable Solutions framework and criteria, please refer to the section E.U. Taxonomy Regulation or the Explanatory Notes on the Allianz company website.

The second action defined is the growth in insurance of low- carbon solutions. This is described in the section Decarbonization

levers and actions related to climate change mitigation for our insurance portfolio.

For proprietary investment opportunities, the action defined is investment in low-carbon solutions. This and the associated target are described in the section Decarbonization levers and actions related to climate change mitigation for our proprietary investment portfolio.

Scope 1 and 2 additional metrics Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the consolidated entities of the Allianz Group are disclosed in the Group GHG emissions table above. The Allianz Group does not have any unconsolidated entities for which it has operational control and would therefore come under the reporting boundary for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. There are therefore no Scope 1 and 2 emissions to be reported for unconsolidated entities. The biogenic emissions resulting from the combustion of biogas and biomass for electricity and heating in our own operations amounted to 3,071.6 tons CO2e, reported separately from the rest of Allianz’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Résumé :  
Le tableau présente les catégories du Scope 3 et indique si elles sont incluses ou exclues. Parmi les 15 catégories, seules 5 sont incluses : les activités liées au carburant et à l'énergie (non incluses dans les Scopes 1 et 2), les déplacements professionnels, le traitement en fin de vie des produits vendus, les franchises et les investissements. Les autres catégories, telles que les biens achetés, les biens d'équipement, le transport en amont et en aval, ainsi que l'utilisation des produits vendus, sont exclues.

### END TABLE 


Scope 3 categories

The significance analysis follows an Allianz internal framework which is aligned with the ESRS requirements and the principles of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The framework considers four criteria to identify material Scope 3 categories: magnitude, influence, sector guidance, and stakeholder expectations. The understanding of these criteria is clearly defined and thresholds for a positive assessment are set. The measured or estimated GHG emissions for the categories excluded are low in magnitude compared to Allianz’s overall Scope 3 emissions. Allianz sees that the guidance for financial institutions on some of these criteria is still evolving and that the framework might change over time.

The percentage of Scope 3 emissions in our GHG inventory is 34 % across our proprietary calculated using primary data investments and own operations.

The relatively low primary data quota is mainly attributed to emissions financed through sovereign debt. We have chosen to incorporate more recent data in calculations, and therefore use the PRIMAP database which includes data up to 2023, instead of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) database, which has data up to 2021. However, only the UNFCCC database is considered as a primary data source, and therefore the primary data quote is lower than if we were to use the UNFCCC database.

GHG emissions intensity The table below presents the GHG intensity using both the location- based and market-based approaches:

Résumé du tableau :
Le tableau compare les données de 2024 et 2023 concernant le volume total des affaires, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GHG) et leur intensité, selon deux méthodologies : basée sur le marché et basée sur la localisation. En 2024, le volume total des affaires a augmenté par rapport à 2023, atteignant 179,777.8 millions d'euros contre 161,700.0 millions d'euros. Les émissions de GHG et leur intensité ont diminué en 2024 par rapport à 2023, que ce soit selon l'approche basée sur le marché ou celle basée sur la localisation.

### END TABLE 


The Allianz Group discloses GHG considerations for the numerator and denominator: intensity with the following

− Net revenue: The Allianz Group does not report a net revenue figure so total business volume is used instead. − Total GHG emissions: The majority of emissions for an insurance company are concentrated in Scope 3, Category 15.

We are constrained by the current development of methodologies and the availability of data. Consequently, we are not yet able to comprehensively cover emissions from all business activities contributing to the total business volume.

### END TABLE 


Opportunities

Through our insurance portfolio (Property-Casualty retail and commercial) and proprietary investments, we are linked to (potential/actual) material indirect impacts. Such impacts may include the production of large amounts of pollution, leading to a potential materialization of adverse indirect impacts for our portfolios.

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long- term)

Risks

For lines within our Property-Casualty business, pollution-related risks may arise from an unanticipated increase in pollution-related claims, in particular following the emergence of new litigation strategies, new regulations or new techniques for measuring and assigning damages. These risks are primarily present within our commercial liability, property and natural resources & construction lines of business. For our Life/Health business, pollution may serve as a source of unforeseen poor health outcomes, especially in relation to emerging potential health threats such as microplastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), or the overuse of fertilizers and pesticides. Returns for our proprietary investment portfolio may also be adversely affected by widespread legal action against a given sector’s pollutive activities or the passage of new pollution regulations that significantly hinder one or more sectors’ business models. On a long-term basis, some sovereign investments may also suffer from local or regional economic drag attributable to excessive pollution. For both our insurance business and proprietary investments, we may also be exposed to reputational damage arising from association with insurance customers or investees publicly criticized for their pollutive activities.




Allianz's strategy on pollution for our Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investments is governed by the ASIS and FRSI. Strategic actions include implementation of due diligence processes to identify, address, and mitigate business activities that may lead to negative pollution-related impacts, risk management activities, and joining engagement initiatives. We continue to enhance our understanding of emerging best practices on pollution-related impacts, risks, and dependencies, and how best to address these in line with our CSRD DMA.

Strategy and business model related to pollution In 2024, the World Economic Forum (WEF) identified “pollution” as one of the top ten global risks by impact over the short and long term 1, and it is one of the five key drivers of biodiversity loss according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)2. Additionally, substances of concern (SOC) and very high concern (SVHC), may have significant and often irreversible impacts on the environment and the health of humans 3. These substances are used in a wide variety of chemicals and products, such as pesticides, insecticides, cyanide, and others which may also

pollute water bodies, potentially degrading water quality and adversely impacting aquatic ecosystems.

impacts, dependencies, risks, and opportunities is an important first step for insurers so that they can effectively prevent, mitigate, and reduce damage from pollution to the environment and human health.

At Allianz, we conduct due diligence and screening of our business transactions to identify adverse pollution-related impacts, in addition to risk management activities to monitor and mitigate the risks associated with pollution. These are outlined in the section Sustainability integration.

For our Property-Casualty retail portfolio, we will monitor the shift toward electric mobility in the retail motor and transport sectors, exploring how best to address this topic in the future.

Policies related to pollution

To address material impacts, we employ the policies and processes outlined in this section.

The ASIS incorporates screening criteria to proactively identify, address, and mitigate business activities that may contribute to negative air, water, and soil (excluding GHG emissions and waste) pollution-related impacts, as part of the referral and due diligence process. Currently, our policy focuses on screening business transactions within the Sensitive Business Areas (SBAs) of Mining, Oil & Gas, Nuclear Energy, Hydro-Electric Power, Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and Infrastructure.

impacts from the inappropriate use of pesticides, fertilizer, insecticides, or other chemicals (e.g., neonicotinoids); the clearance by fire or location on sensitive soils or peatlands for palm oil; the use of cyanide or cyanide- related processes; and practices of riverine or submarine tailings disposal. In doing so, we can also identify the use of SOCs and SVHCs in business activities where it is most relevant or critical, i.e., within certain SBAs such as Mining and Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry. However, the ASIS does not specifically address the substitution or phasing out of substances of concern or very high concern.

importance of addressing the avoidance, control, and limitation of emergency situations, the ASIS also screens business activities in Oil & Gas to identify the lack of spill management, response, and remediation plans in line with industry best practices such as the IPIECA Oil & Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainable Reporting and the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. For more information on the ASIS, the referral process, and how we measure and track the effectiveness of our policies, please refer to section Sustainability integration.

The FRSI describes all relevant rules, principles, and sustainability integration processes for the proprietary investment portfolio of the Allianz Group. We evaluate the potential negative impacts of pollution, in terms of ESRS E2, as part of the internal Adverse Impact Steering process for listed assets and the referral process of the ASIS for non-listed assets. This covers the material sustainability matters “Pollution of air, water, and soil,” “Substances of concern and very high

103 E2 Pollution

concern,” and “Microplastics.” For further information about the FRSI and the Adverse Impact Steering process, refer to the section Sustainability integration.

Targets related to pollution

This section addresses the status at the Allianz Group of quantifiable pollution targets and outlines the challenges and our strategic learning approach.

For our insurance and proprietary investment portfolios, we have not yet set any measurable outcome-oriented targets for pollution. This is an emerging area which is complex and multi-faceted. The implementation of targets is currently challenging for insurers and investors due to the lack of standardized methodologies and metrics for target-setting, as well as challenges with data availability.

We are currently in the phase of learning and developing our understanding of these emerging sustainability issues and exploring how best to address this topic in line with our CSRD DMA.

Actions related to pollution

We implement specific actions to act on material impacts and mitigate material risks (see section Materiality).

As an institutional investor, one of the most effective actions we can take to reduce our negative impact and mitigate risks associated with pollution is engagement. In 2023, we became a member of the Investor Initiative on Hazardous Chemicals (IIHC), which advocates for enhanced transparency and disclosure from chemical companies concerning products that are, or contain hazardous substances. Additionally, it also calls for the publication of time-bound phase-out plans for products that are, or contain, persistent chemicals, and the development of safer alternatives for hazardous chemicals. Over 70 investors are involved in the initiative with USD 18 tn in assets under management, and engage with more than 50 companies from various to regions over several years. The Allianz Group contributes collaborative policy engagement and to two company engagements. insurance portfolios concerning pollution specifically; however, several actions are taken with regards to climate change which also mitigate our pollution impact, such as our engagement with customers to support their

transition to electric mobility, which is described in more detail in section E1 Climate change.

Opportunities

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long- term) Through our insurance portfolio (Property-Casualty commercial) and proprietary investments, we are linked to (potential/actual) material indirect impacts. Such impacts may include high levels of water usage and the exploitation of marine ecosystems, leading to a potential materialization of adverse indirect impacts for our portfolios.

For our proprietary investments, adverse developments in investment returns may occur due to exposures to sectors or regions whose business models are directly or indirectly dependent on available or low-cost fresh water supplies, such as within the agricultural, manufacturing, or utility sectors. The health of local or regional economies may also be impacted by water scarcity or the depletion of marine resources, with corresponding knock-on effects for both Property-Casualty and Life/Health insurance demand and investment returns. Within our life insurance business, water scarcity may lead to higher-than-expected regional mortality rates due to the presence of unsanitary conditions and the spread of waterborne diseases.

Risks




Strategy and business model related to water and marine resources Protecting and managing freshwater and marine resources is essential for the maintenance of ecosystems, and to support human livelihoods, food security, and a variety of economic activities. However, these resources are under increasing pressure from unsustainable resource extraction, pollution, and industrial and urban development. As a result, the responsible use of freshwater and marine resources should play a significant role in corporate sustainability. At the Allianz Group, we have implemented policies to address issues related to water and marine resources across our Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investment activities, as detailed in the next section.

At the Allianz Group, we conduct due diligence and screening of our business transactions to identify adverse water and marine resource-related impacts, and risk management activities to monitor and mitigate the associated risks. These are outlined in the section Sustainability integration. We will continue to develop our actions to better identify, manage, and mitigate negative impacts and risks associated with water and marine resource use.

Allianz's strategy on water and marine resources within our Property- Casualty insurance and proprietary investments is governed by the ASIS and FRSI. Our strategic actions focus on implementing risk management activities and due diligence processes to identify, address, and mitigate business activities that could negatively impact water and marine resources. We continue to enhance our understanding of emerging best practices on related impacts, risks, and dependencies. This includes exploring their interconnections with other topics such as pollution and biodiversity, and how best to address these in line with our CSRD DMA.

104 E3 Water and Marine Resources

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Policies related to water and marine resources To address material impacts, we employ the policies and processes outlined in this section.

The ASIS incorporates screening criteria to proactively identify, address, and mitigate business activities with the potential to trigger water- and marine resource-related impacts, as part of the referral and due diligence process. Currently, our policy focuses on screening business transactions within specific sectors along the value chain, namely the Sensitive Business Areas (SBAs) of Infrastructure, Oil & Gas, Hydro-Electric Power, and Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry. This approach enables the Allianz Group to reflect and manage the diverse and nuanced material impacts across different economic activities.

We address water management issues by screening business activities in Infrastructure, Oil & Gas, and Hydroelectric Power to identify impacts on water resources through the extraction of ground and surface water from hydraulic fracturing, the lack of water reclamation in tar/oil sands tailing ponds, and up- and downstream impacts flooding) which can damage ecosystems. For information on how we address water pollution-related impacts, please refer to the section E2 Pollution.

Considering the potential widespread environmental issues and significant adverse impacts on water and marine resources from drilling for oil in sensitive locations (e.g., the Arctic region), we also screen business activities in Oil & Gas to identify any impacts that may contribute to severe damage within the Arctic Circle, including offshore drilling, with additional restrictions applied to ultra-deep-sea drilling, as specified in the Allianz Statement on Oil & Gas-based business models.

in Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry, we can identify the use of unconventional aquaculture practices, including the use of wild-caught juvenile fish for tuna and eel species, poor site selection, and practicing illegal and damaging fishing techniques such as bottom trawling, use of poisons or explosives, and poor by-catch management, that do not support practices related to sustainable oceans and seas.

For more information on the ASIS, the referral process, and how we measure and track the effectiveness of our policies, please see the section Sustainability integration.

Given the digital nature of our financial products, we do not rely on water or marine resources in the product design processes, and have therefore not adopted policies related to water treatment toward

105 E3 Water and Marine Resources

more sustainable sourcing of water. We have also not adopted policies or targets to reduce water consumption in areas at water risk across our insurance and proprietary investment activities. We are currently in the phase of learning and developing our understanding of these emerging sustainability areas and exploring how best to address this topic in line with our materiality assessment.

For information concerning Allianz’s non-life insurance products and how these address water-related issues and the preservation of marine resources, please refer to the section E.U. Taxonomy for non- life, including information about Allianz’s Sustainable Solutions.

The FRSI describes all relevant rules, principles, and sustainability integration processes for the proprietary investment portfolio of the Allianz Group. We evaluate potential negative impacts on water and marine resources, in terms of ESRS E3, as part of the internal Adverse Impact Steering process for listed assets and the referral process of the ASIS for non-listed assets. This covers the material sustainability matters “Water consumption” and “Water withdrawals.” For further information about the FRSI and the Adverse Impact Steering process, refer to the section Sustainability integration.

Targets and actions related to water and marine resources We have not set any measurable outcome-oriented targets and actions for water and marine resources across our insurance and proprietary investment portfolios. Being an emerging area for insurers; the is challenging due to its complex, multi-faceted nature, a lack of standardized methodologies and metrics for target setting, and constraints with data quality and coverage.

As part of the CSRD DMA, water was deemed not material for Own Operations. However, we had previously set a reduction target across Allianz Own Operations of 10 % water consumption per employee by year-end 2025 versus a 2019 baseline. With a baseline value of 1,984,896 m3, this translates to an absolute water consumption target of 1,786,406 m3 by year-end 2025. The target was voluntary in nature and, as of 2024, the Allianz Group had exceeded the planned year- end 2025 target. Due to being deemed not material, the Allianz Group will not track this target any more or report on associated metrics.

E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems

– Adverse impact + Positive impact

Through our insurance portfolio (Property-Casualty retail and commercial), proprietary investments, and asset management, we are linked to (potential/actual) material indirect impacts. Such impacts may include contributions to the loss of biodiversity and alterations of ecosystems, leading to a potential materialization of adverse indirect impacts for our portfolios. As a concrete example, the sustainability matter “impact on the extent and condition of ecosystems” has been identified as material for our insurance portfolio (Property-Casualty commercial), as we may be linked to adverse indirect impacts on account of being exposed to sectors which may contribute to land degradation, desertification, or soil sealing. We have no operations that affect threatened species as it is not material for our own operations.

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long-term)

For our Property-Casualty business, risks include higher than expected claim costs attributable to natural resource scarcity or a reduction in natural buffers that mitigate damage from extreme weather events, such as floodplains, wetlands and forests. Claims may also arise from legal exposures of customers judged responsible for damages attributable to a loss of biodiversity. For our Life/Health business, biodiversity loss introduces several new vectors with potential impacts on human health and mortality, such as an increase in infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, or poor diets and malnutrition. General disruptions to socio-economic stability may also occur; these may constitute a precursor to deteriorating health outcomes insofar as they disrupt preventive care, vaccination programs, or the early treatment of illnesses or diseases. For our proprietary investments, adverse developments in investment returns may be attributable to investments in sectors vulnerable to the consequences of biodiversity loss, for example material scarcity (construction, manufacturing), reduced yields (agriculture), or a downturn in the attractiveness or utility of natural areas for leisure purposes (property, tourism). Similarly, adverse returns may occur on a regional or sectoral basis due to biodiversity-related litigation or new regulations, as well as the deterioration of natural buffers that help mitigate physical damage and business disruption due to extreme weather events. For both our insurance business and proprietary investments, we may also be exposed to reputational damage arising from association with insurance customers or investees publicly criticized for their contribution towards a loss in biodiversity.

Risks




Strategy and business model related to biodiversity and ecosystems Biodiversity refers to the variability of types of life on our planet, encompassing all species and the ecosystems that house them, and underpins the functioning of ecosystem services such as pollination, flood protection, and carbon sequestration, which in turn support functioning societies and resilient economies.

To address biodiversity within our Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investments, the Allianz Group focuses on the implementation of due diligence processes to identify, address, and mitigate business activities that may adversely impact biodiversity and ecosystems, risk management activities, and participating in engagement initiatives. For our asset management, AllianzGI and PIMCO align with fiduciary obligations to meet customer needs. We also conducted pilot LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) assessments for a small sub-portfolio of our proprietary investments, to enhance understanding of emerging best practices on biodiversity and nature-related impacts, risks, and dependencies, and potential mitigation activities at organizational level.

The 2019 IPBES Report identified biodiversity loss as being driven by five main impact drivers: climate change (see section E1 Climate change); land use change (e.g., land artificialization), freshwater use change and sea use change; direct exploitation; invasive alien species; and pollution (see section E2 Pollution), which significantly undermine biodiversity and the value it provides to people, societies, and economies. The World Bank estimates that the loss of select ecosystem services such as wild pollination, food provision from marine fisheries, and timber from native forests, could lead to losses in annual global

GDP of USD 2.7 tn by 2030 1, while the WEF identified biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as the third most severe risk on a global scale over the next ten years in its 2024 Global Risks Report 2.

To mitigate these pressures on biodiversity, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework set four goals for 2050, and 2030 targets toward preserving and conserving the value of nature and ecosystem services to the environment, communities, and economies. Businesses are both affected by and dependent on these ecosystem services and their underlying biodiversity to varying degrees. As such, it is important for insurers to monitor and manage the negative impacts and associated risks on biodiversity and ecosystems. Although biodiversity loss and its main drivers are well documented, the quantification of the impacts of business activities on biodiversity is still an emerging area.

At Allianz, we conduct due diligence and screening of business transactions to identify adverse biodiversity and ecosystem-related impacts.

We also assess our biodiversity and ecosystem-related physical and transition risks as well as the resilience of our strategy and business model to material risks. A summary of Allianz’s material biodiversity- and ecosystem-related risks can be found in the table Material impacts, risks, and opportunities of Allianz for E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems (SBM-3) at the beginning of this section, while the resilience analysis is presented in the subsection Resilience Analysis. As outlined in the section Methodology and process to identify and assess material impacts, risks, and opportunities biodiversity and ecosystem- related physical and transition risks were assessed at a systemic level.

Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems To address material impacts, we employ the policies and processes outlined in this section.

The ASIS incorporates screening criteria to proactively identify business activities with the potential to trigger biodiversity-related impacts as part of the referral and due diligence process. Our policy focuses on screening business transactions across specific sectors along our value chain, namely, the Sensitive Business Areas (SBAs) of Mining, Oil & Gas, Nuclear Energy, Hydro-Electric Power, Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry, and Infrastructure.

1_World Bank Group_The Economic Case for Nature.

107 E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems

To address land (e.g., land artificialization), freshwater and sea use changes; the extent and condition of ecosystems from land degradation, desertification, and soil sealing; and deforestation, the ASIS screens business activities for negative impacts to protected areas (such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), national parks, native protected areas, marine protection areas, etc.) and primary forests. These apply to the SBAs of Mining, Oil & Gas, Hydro-electric Power, Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry, and Infrastructure. illegal

fishing activities, unsustainable harvesting, the use of rare timber species, and unconventional aquaculture practices, the ASIS identifies business activities in Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry with the potential to trigger impacts from direct exploitation and deforestation.

To address impacts on the state of species, the ASIS screens business activities to identify impacts on endangered species listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, as well as the absence of mitigation measures to reduce such impacts. Additionally, business activities related to Animal Testing are screened for the use of great apes (e.g., chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, etc.) or wild-caught subjects. To address sustainable land and agriculture practices, the ASIS screens business activities in Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry to identify the use of monoculture techniques, the conversion of food crops to energy crops, and any site clearing using fire or location on marginal fragile soils.

While current policies on biodiversity (i.e., the ASIS) do not directly address impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services, screening business activities in certain SBAs will indirectly address this topic, as our business activities and operations rely on resources such as timber and water. For example, we screen business activities in Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry to identify negative impacts related to illegal logging or fishing, the use of rare species, the unsustainable harvesting of timber, unconventional fishing and aquaculture practices, which impact ecosystem services such as climate regulation, and flood and storm protection. Additionally, screening business activities in Mining and Oil & Gas for negative impacts related to mountain and hilltop removal, and hydraulic fracturing, well construction integrity, or direct links to water scarcity, could also be seen as indirectly addressing ecosystem services such as water quality and erosion control.

We have not specifically adopted policies to support the traceability of products, components, and raw materials along our value chain. However, to prevent and mitigate impacts to ecosystems

2_WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2024.pdf (weforum.org).

and their resilience, we also recognize the importance of screening business activities in Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry for potential or actual impacts from illegal logging/fishing practices and other unsustainable harvesting and/or aquaculture practices.

For more information on the ASIS, the referral process and how we measure and track the effectiveness of our policies, please refer to the section Sustainability integration.

The FRSI describes all relevant rules, principles, and sustainability integration processes for the proprietary investment portfolio of the Allianz Group. We evaluate potential negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, in terms of ESRS E4, as part of the internal Adverse Impact Steering process for listed assets and the referral process of the ASIS for non-listed assets. This covers the material sustainability matters “Direct drivers of biodiversity loss,” “Impacts on the state of species and the extent and condition of ecosystems,” and “Impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services.” For further information about the FRSI and the Adverse Impact Steering process, refer to the section Sustainability integration.

The Allianz Group’s third-party assets under management3 and its two major asset managers, AllianzGI and PIMCO, do not have nature-related policies as defined under ESRS (they do not reference objectives or targets, contain action plans, and are not included in PIMCO´s or AllianzGI’s governance rules). However, as fiduciaries, PIMCO and AllianzGI manage their customer assets in accordance with the customer’s investment guidelines and objectives. These guidelines are expressed through the investment management agreement, prospectus, or other foundational documents.

Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems We have not set any measurable outcome-oriented targets for biodiversity and ecosystems across our value chain. This remains a challenging area for the insurance industry, given its complexity and multi-faceted nature across sector and geographic specificities, and the role of indigenous and other affected communities. This is further compounded by constraints related to the measurement of – and accessibility to – comparable disclosed data at scale, standardized methodologies, and metrics.

We are currently in the phase of learning and developing our understanding of these emerging sustainability areas and exploring how best to address this topic in line with our CSRD DMA.

Actions related to biodiversity and ecosystems Biodiversity loss poses a risk for businesses and their supply chains, thereby impacting financial risks for investors. As an institutional investor, one of the most effective actions we can take to mitigate these risks is through multilateral engagements, supporting greater corporate ambition and action on biodiversity. This was therefore a key area of focus in 2024, leading us to join the following engagement initiatives:

Nature Action 100 is a global investor-led engagement initiative which aims to reverse nature and biodiversity loss. There are over 230 investors in assets under management. 100 companies have been identified across eight key sectors to engage with under the initiative. The Allianz Group actively contributes to two company engagements in the food and beverage retail sector.

Spring is a PRI stewardship initiative for nature which aims to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation with a focus on political engagements. Over 220 investors with a collective USD 16 tn in assets under management are involved (as endorsers) in the initiative. The initiative’s Working Group will engage with 60 focus companies, selected across priority geographies and level of policy influence. We actively contribute to two company engagements in the mining and food sectors.

Mining 2030 is an investor-led initiative which aims for a socially and environmentally responsible mining sector with biodiversity, land, and Protected Areas as one of the key focus areas. 82 investors are involved, with a combined USD 15 tn in assets under management. We have identified a focus company and plan to commence the engagement in 2025.

These engagements usually run for several years, and we expect them to drive meaningful conservation efforts and promote sustainable practices.

108 E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems

Assessing the biodiversity impacts, dependencies, and risks of our investment and underwriting portfolio is an emerging topic for us and much of the insurance industry. In 2024, we focused on evaluating the data sources and tools available to conduct LEAP assessments across several priority asset classes in our proprietary investment portfolio. We will consider the next reasonable steps in 2025 based on our findings.

We are committed to enhancing our understanding of emerging biodiversity concepts and exploring their into our sustainability approach. This includes nature-based solutions, which have been identified as promising in recent reports such as the UN’s State of Nature for Finance and Nature-Positive Insurance. However, the reports also point out several challenges, such as the ownership of natural assets, risk and impact considerations, and insufficient data and modelling capabilities. As such, the Allianz Group has not adopted the use of nature-based solutions to date, nor have we incorporated local and indigenous knowledge and biodiversity offsets into our action plan.

### END TABLE 


For our Property-Casualty business, material scarcity may trigger adverse claim rate developments within our property, construction, and automotive lines of business due to higher levels of volatility in building, repair and replacement costs. Our customers’ potential adoption of novel materials, processes, and technologies as a response to material scarcity – whether for regulatory mandated or economic reasons – may likewise result in actual loss rates exceeding expected loss rates due to unforeseen shifts in the insured risk profile. Fundamental changes in market size or the types of products or coverages may also emerge. For our proprietary investments, adoption of a circular economy may negatively impact the value of our investments in sectors or countries whose value generation is heavily dependent on the extraction, distribution, processing or utilization of scarce and non-renewable natural resources. Geopolitical tensions around resource scarcity may also emerge, for example in the form of export restrictions, that negatively impact investment returns on a regional or sectoral basis. For our own operations and supply chain, risks include higher operating costs due to higher prices for sustainable products and services, such as IT. Reputational damage may also occur should Allianz utilize suppliers which are publicly criticized for unsustainable resource consumption.

For our insurance portfolio (Property-Casualty retail), we see material opportunities associated with our sustainable claims initiative (repair instead of replace), as the increased usage of second-hand repair materials can be less costly than using or replacing with new materials.



To address resource use and circular economy in our Property- Casualty insurance and proprietary investments, we implement risk management activities and due diligence processes to identify, address, and mitigate business activities that could adversely impact resource use. For our own operations, we strategically focus on sustainable procurement practices, in addition to recycling and re-using end-of-life IT equipment. We continue to enhance our understanding of emerging best practices on resource use-related impacts, risks, and depen- dencies, and how best to address these in line with our CSRD DMA.

Strategy and business model related to resource use and the circular economy Today, most resources are extracted, processed, and consumed unsustainably, generating waste, toxic emissions, and pollution, which adversely impact environmental and human health. The extraction and processing of material resources can also be attributed to around 50 % of GHG emissions 1, while direct exploitation, leading to depletion of resources, has been identified as one of the key drivers of

biodiversity loss by the IPBES2. Therefore, sustainable resource use and management are imperative to meet the demands of increasing urbanization and industrialization and support the transition to net- zero.

The impacts from resource extraction and use vary significantly across sectors and geographies, influenced by business activities to different extents. Increasing attention is now being placed on practices such as circular economy, resource efficiency, sustainable sourcing, and the use of renewable resources.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

At Allianz, we conduct due diligence and screening of our business transactions to identify adverse resource use and circular economy- related impacts, and risk management activities to monitor and mitigate the risks associated with resource use and the circular economy. These are outlined in the section Sustainability integration.

Understanding and addressing resource management issues is important to reduce the intensity of natural resource consumption and support the transition to a circular economy. We are currently in the phase of learning and developing our understanding of these emerging sustainability areas.

For example, for our Property-Casualty retail portfolio, we will continue to develop a better understanding of impact remediation and opportunities, exploring how best to address this topic in the future, whilst maintaining our efforts to sustain a positive impact on the circular economy. Such efforts are already in place in motor claims, where repair instead of replace is a core initiative. Through lifecycle analysis (LCA) research, we see that repairing a damaged vehicle part causes fewer emissions than replacing the part. The next best option we see, if repair is not possible from a technical perspective, is the replacement with used parts, which is already addressed in various markets by now.

Policies related to resource use and the circular economy To address material impacts, we employ the policies and processes outlined in this section.

The FRSO addresses the material adverse impacts in Allianz Own Operations from non-renewable resources inflows (with special attention to IT equipment), as well as material resource outflows, namely E-waste related to IT equipment. For further information on the FRSO, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS policies.

The FRSO supports the procurement of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient products, as part of our approach to move away from the use of virgin resources by preferentially procuring IT equipment with a higher share of recycled material.

The FRSO also addresses three aspects of the waste hierarchy – re-use, recycling, and disposal – through prioritizing the avoidance of e-waste related to IT equipment, where possible, and promoting the re-use of end-of-life IT equipment. We have published an internal catalog with minimum standards and recommendations for re-using IT equipment and recycling e-waste related to IT equipment.

110 E5 Resource Use and Circular Economy

Additionally, the VCoC, which is a core element of the supplier registration process in our standard procurement tool, used by most Allianz entities, requests that vendors establish and implement environmental management practices across their supply chain, including the reduction of waste through reuse and recycling, and safe handling, storage, and disposal of chemicals. To ensure our vendors contribute to our ambition, particularly within IT, we have implemented sustainability criteria in our tenders within in-scope categories. The catalog of questions covers several environmental aspects and produces a rating based on defined criteria.

To manage our material impacts related to resource use and circular economy, the ASIS incorporates screening criteria to proactively identify business activities with the potential to trigger adverse impacts related to resource use across specific sectors along our value chain. This approach enables the Allianz Group to reflect and manage the diverse and nuanced material impacts across different economic activities. Currently, our policy focuses on screening business transactions within the Sensitive Business Areas (SBAs) of Mining, Oil & Gas, Nuclear Energy, Hydro-Electric Power, Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry, and Infrastructure, to identify:

− Resource use issues from sites, and associated transport and

infrastructure; Identification of illegal logging or unsustainable harvesting, or use of rare timber species; as well as Illegal fishing or damaging techniques such as bottom trawling, beach seining, large-scale pelagic driftnets, poisons, explosives, “muroami,” and poor bycatch management.

Impacts related to waste are addressed through screening business activities in Mining for practices of river or submarine tailing disposal being conducted, and for tar/oil sands tailing ponds lacking water reclamation for business activities in Oil & Gas. Further criteria support the identification, assessment, and management of business activities that address a lack of sustainable sourcing and the use of renewable resources.

We have not adopted policies for the relative increases of secondary resources as part of our transition away from use of virgin resources in our insurance and proprietary investment activities. We recognize this is a complex area and are currently in the phase of learning and developing our understanding of these emerging

sustainability issues and exploring how best to address this topic in line with our materiality assessment.

The FRSI describes all relevant rules, principles, and sustainability integration processes for the proprietary investment portfolio of the Allianz Group. We evaluate potential negative impacts on the circular economy, in terms of ESRS E5, as part of the internal Adverse Impact Steering process for listed assets and the referral process of the ASIS for non-listed assets. This covers the material sustainability matters “Resources inflows, including resource use,” “Resource outflows related to products and services,” and “Waste.” For further information about the FRSI and the Adverse Impact Steering process, refer to the section Sustainability integration.

Targets related to resource use and the circular economy We have not yet set any measurable outcome-oriented targets for resource use and the circular economy across our own operations and value chain. Being an emerging area for insurers, the implementation of targets is challenging due to its complex, multi-faceted nature, a lack of standardized methodologies and metrics for target-setting, and data constraints.

As we start reporting resource-related metrics in the 2024 fiscal year for our own operations, an assessment of the 2024 baseline needs to be conducted prior to the introduction of resource-related operational targets.

In previous years, the Allianz Group had set targets to reduce waste by 10 % per employee by year-end 2025 and paper use by 20 % per policy by year-end 2025. Both targets were set against a 2019 baseline and as of 2023 the Allianz Group had exceeded both 2025 targets. As these topics are not material as determined by the CSRD DMA and the targets have been achieved, the Allianz Group will no longer track progress against these sustainability matters.

Actions related to resource use and the circular economy In our own operations, our current priority is to collect data on the new “IT inflow” and “E-waste related to IT equipment” indicators for the 2024 fiscal year. After the initial data collection process, we will set a baseline and conduct a thorough data analysis. If actions are required, we plan to define them in the following years.

For our insurances and proprietary investment portfolios, we do not yet have any actions concerning resource use and the circular economy.

Metrics related to resource use and the circular economy

Resource inflow

As a result of our CSRD DMA for Allianz Own Operations, IT equipment was identified as a material non-renewable resource. For further information, see the section Materiality.

Allianz’s office-based operations are heavily reliant on a diverse array of IT equipment, highlighting the importance of IT hardware procurement tracking. We define the metric of IT inflow as the total weight of IT hardware acquired.

To determine this, the number of IT equipment items procured by Allianz Group in the reporting year is multiplied by the average weight of the corresponding IT equipment category. Data is collected via supplier-based measurement or calculations from subsidiaries within the environmental reporting boundary. The data is extrapolated based on time and for any non-covered headcount to cover 100 % of the Allianz Group headcount. The final figure is computed by adding together the pertinent sub-indicators. Nine IT equipment categories were defined based on typically used IT equipment in our offices and mapped to their corresponding average weights.

111 E5 Resource Use and Circular Economy

IT equipment categories include the following items which reflect the main categories of IT equipment used for Allianz operations:

− Notebooks − Phones − Tablets − Monitors − Desktop PCs − Servers − Printers − Other lightweight equipment − Other heavyweight equipment

All IT software and services are excluded, as well as non-IT electronic equipment like refrigerators.

The table below shows the IT equipment inflow from Allianz Own Operations. As this is the inaugural year for reporting this metric, no comparison period is available. The following metric has not been separately validated by an external body.

E-waste

Under resource outflow, we have identified e-waste linked to IT equipment as a material topic for Allianz Own Operations. E-waste linked to IT equipment is the only type of waste considered material for our own operations, excluding non-IT electronic equipment such as refrigerators or ovens. We assume that all e-waste is hazardous and do not consider radioactive waste applicable to Allianz.

E-waste data is either weighed directly or collected in the number of IT equipment items which is then converted to weight, applying the same methodology as for IT equipment inflow. Data is collected via supplier-based measurement or calculations from subsidiaries within the environmental reporting boundary. Some of the materials which arise in Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment and therefore may be present in our e-waste include metals (e.g., steel, copper, aluminum), glass, plastics, toxic heavy metals, and hazardous chemicals.

1_For cases where the classification of E-Waste was not entirely clear or was an overlap of 'prepared for re-use' and 'recycled', the respective E-Waste quantity was reported as 'other recovery operations' to avoid double counting.

2_'Non-recycled E-Waste' is the sum of the categories 'preparation for re-use', 'other recovery operations', 'incineration', landfill' and 'other disposal operations'.

3_The percentage of total non-recycled E-waste generated is the total non-recycled E-waste

divided by the total E-waste, multiplied by 100.

As e-waste was reported for the first time, the quality of the majority of the data was not sufficient to classify it according to the different recovery categories. As a result, and to maintain a conservative approach, e-waste has been reported as 'other disposal operations' where there was no evidence of recovery. We plan to improve the quality and granularity of the data and therefore expect the amount of e-waste reported as 'other disposal operations' to decrease next year.

E.U. TAXONOMY REGULATION

Regulatory background

E.U. Taxonomy alignment

Under the Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework, the Technical Screening Criteria (Annex 2, 10.1, Commission Delegated Regulation (E.U.) 2021/2139) (Climate Delegated Act) supplementing the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation serve as minimum requirements to qualify products as sustainable. Simultaneously, the Technical Screening Criteria are used as guidance for our product development with the objective of increasing the resilience of our insurance activities and supporting our customers in building adaptive capacity.

The Taxonomy alignment of an activity goes beyond Taxonomy eligibility. For non-life insurance business, it implies that the insurance activity substantially contributes to climate change adaptation, does not significantly harm the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards, and complies with the Technical Screening Criteria. We have screened our entire eligible non-life insurance portfolio under Article 3 of the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation and the Technical Screening Criteria and are reporting accordingly. For the aligned revenues we only consider the share in the premiums for the coverage of climate related perils.

The E.U. Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) is a “green” classification system that translates the E.U.’s environmental objectives into criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable and the degree to which an investment is environmentally sustainable. The disclosure of the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned revenues allows for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios, in order to channel capital flows toward sustainable activities. The Taxonomy-aligned ratios for both, non-life (re)insurance and proprietary investment activities, have far reaching limitations which we explain in the respective sections.

For non-life insurance activities, the Climate Delegated Act has established “climate change adaptation” as the only potential substantial contribution to environmental objectives as laid out in the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation.

It is in the nature of new regulations that not all details are specified, and a common understanding and application needs to be developed across markets to achieve consistency and comparability. To ensure consistent application across all Allianz entities, we have developed internal guidelines and taken a conservative approach, where screening criteria left room for interpretation. The following illustrates those aspects that we deem to be the most important and challenging:

The Climate Delegated Act and the Technical Screening Criteria set forth therein predominantly expect insurance activities to adequately reflect climate-related risks and support customers and society in building resilience against the adverse effects of climate change. It consequently reflects the traditional role of the insurance industry as risk manager. Only the “do no significant harm” and “minimum safeguards” criteria set additional requirements for Taxonomy-alignment beyond the contribution to climate change adaptation.

E.U. Taxonomy Regulation for non-life insurance business: Underwriting of climate-related perils

We regard the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation in the broader context and consequently report on it in combination with our Sustainable Solutions framework.

Leadership in modelling and pricing of climate risks State-of-the-art modelling techniques (1.1): Assessing and pricing risks adequately is key for a sustainable and resilient insurance operation. The Allianz approach to state-of-the-art pricing is the Technical Price System as part of our Technical Excellence initiative. In the existing Technical Price Certification (TPC), portfolios are screened on a regular basis across the Allianz Group. A successful TPC requires (but is not limited to), that the technical price is available at insurance policy level. This includes the best estimate of all future expected costs of the risk (including the expected ultimate loss) as a forward-looking scenario. Both output from hazard mapping and NatCat risk models are included in expected claims costs. Where and to the extent that a portfolio meets our internal TPC requirements, we have concluded that predicted costs of climate-related hazards are properly reflected in the Technical Price at best estimate.

impose business restrictions or material requirements for insurance activities. Instead, it introduces disclosure obligations for the insurance Lines of Business (LoBs) in scope.

It is an integral part of our strategy to not only insure our customers against risks, but also to support them with their challenges in a world which is transitioning to a more sustainable way of living and doing business. We aim to create real-world impact through our business activities and contribute to ESG objectives based on science and international agreements. This is based on the understanding that Property- Casualty (P&C) insurance can support multiple ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation. The role of the insurance industry is not limited to the classic role of risk managers but goes beyond and includes public expectations to accelerate the fair and just transition of economies and societies.

E.U. Taxonomy eligibility

The eight LoBs of non-life insurance laid down in the Technical Screening Criteria are in scope of the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation (“Taxonomy-eligible”), as the insurance products sold under these LoBs have the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation. We define all P&C LoBs laid down in Annex 2 section 10.1 of the Climate Delegated Act as eligible and they have been included in the Taxonomy-alignment screening. For the eligible revenues, the full premiums are considered and no climate related peril share is applied.

Therefore, we have established a comprehensive framework for Allianz Sustainable Solutions, including guidelines, screening criteria and definitions, a certification grid, governance, and defined processes to safeguard us against greenwashing risks, and provide strategic guidance to explore business opportunities.

112 E.U. Taxonomy Regulation

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Provide incentives for risk reduction (1.3): This criterion is based on the fundamental understanding that the insurer should protect itself and set incentives for customers to protect themselves or their assets against the adverse effects of climate change. Therefore, it is necessary, however sufficient, if the climate-related exposure is considered in pricing as a price signal of risk (e.g., hazard zones) or in terms and conditions such as deductibles or limits, that serve as a differentiator for respective exposures.

Product design Risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders (2.1): The regulator expects an insurance product to include risk-based rewards for customers to take preventive actions to protect themselves or their insured assets against climate change risks. Other than for the previous risk-reduction”), differentiation related solely to the location of a risk is not sufficient. We define preventive actions as any specific measures that can be taken by customers if they are suitable to reduce either the frequency or severity of climate change-related claims. They must be considered in the product and be offered to all customers. Risk-based rewards must be reflected in the technical price, and there must be a direct relation between the preventive measure taken by the customer, and the risk-based reward granted. Hence, general deductibles which do not refer to specific preventive measures or “no claims discounts” are not sufficient.

The distribution strategy for such products covers measures to ensure that policyholders are informed on the relevance of preventive measures (2.2): The regulator sees adaptation to climate change risks as an overall societal objective to which insurers and their customers should contribute, since risk prevention is a key lever for reducing the overall economic burden. Thus, the distribution strategy must include measures to ensure that customers (new and existing) are informed about the preventive measures and the relevance of such preventive measures that they could take. Information on the relevance of preventive measures can be shared individually (e.g., through customer-specific risk assessment reports in commercial business) or in is appropriate for retail business (e.g., through general, which information in newsletters, regular contract-related communication, or terms and conditions). It is also appropriate to briefly inform the customers about the topic and direct them to more detailed information, for instance on a company website.

1_Principles for Sustainable Insurance – United Nations Environment – Finance Initiative (unepfi.org).

113 E.U. Taxonomy Regulation

Do no significant harm (“DNSH”) - Climate change mitigation

The DNSH criterion defines which insurance activities related to customers engaged in the fossil fuel value chain must not be classified as sustainable (Taxonomy-aligned). We define the fossil fuel value chain extensively as upstream (e.g., exploration, extraction), midstream (e.g., transport, storage, pipelines), or downstream (e.g., refinery, trading, including gas stations) activities or related assets. and sales Additionally, we consider commercially used fossil fuel power plants to be part of the fossil fuel value chain. Beyond that, the end-use of fossil fuels is not in scope of this criterion (e.g., combustion engine vehicles or oil-fired heating systems). Thus, the DNSH criterion is automatically fulfilled for retail business, as private use is considered as end-use.

In our portfolio screening approach, we applied the International Standard of Industrial Classification of economic activities (ISIC codes) to identify insurance policies which are not in line with the DNSH criterion as defined above: The different ISIC codes have been classified as either compliant with DNSH, not compliant with DNSH, or to be assessed on an individual customer level. We have screened our portfolios against this internal classification system. As our commercial risks are allocated to ISIC codes (or comparable national or internal classifications), we could identify insurance policies and revenues which do not comply with DNSH. There are no further environmental objectives besides “climate change mitigation” that insurance activities could significantly harm according to the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation, meaning that an assessment of further DNSH criteria is not applicable. These are still indicated with a “Y” in the “The underwriting KPI for non-life insurance and reinsurance undertakings” template below.

Minimum Safeguards

Taxonomy-aligned activities need to be carried out in compliance with Minimum Safeguards with respect to the value chain (i.e., with respect to policyholders in the insurance context). Minimum Safeguards require a due diligence process. Our approach is guided by the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This is ensured by our Sustainability referral process governed by the Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability, which applies to insurance transactions following a risk-based approach. For more information on the Sustainability referral process, please refer to the Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework, version 6.0 on the Allianz company website.

Overall results of E.U. Taxonomy Screening

In 2023 we focused on screening our existing product portfolio and worked on immediate actions to close gaps in existing products. In 2024 we have increased the share of Taxonomy-aligned revenues compared to the previous year, by developing and offering further new Taxonomy-aligned products to our customers.

Limitations of reported numbers

The taxonomy aligned share has limitations in the methodology which imply limitations in the reported numbers. First only the share related to the coverage for climate related perils in the premiums of a taxonomy aligned product can be reported as taxonomy aligned revenues and not the full premiums of the policies. In addition the taxonomy aligned share is calculated with the total revenues from eligible and non-eligible line of businesses in the denominator. This means that the denominator includes insurance business which is not in scope of the regulation and therefore cannot be taxonomy aligned going forward. As a result, the taxonomy aligned share is per definition limited.

Allianz’s Sustainable Solutions

Changing customer expectations and demands as well as regulatory evolution are modifying the role of the insurance industry and require a dedicated strategy to manage the impact of sustainability in P&C Business. The Principles for Sustainable Insurance published by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) outline a strategic approach where all activities in the insurance value chain – including interactions with stakeholders – are performed in a responsible and forward-looking way by identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks and opportunities associated with environmental and social issues. The sustainability requirements aim to reduce risks, develop improve business performance, and contribute to environmental, social, and economic sustainability1.

Against this background, we developed an enhanced Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework applicable since 1 January 2023. We reported under this framework for the first time in 2023.

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

The Sustainable Solutions framework is based on regulatory requirements (e.g., the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation) as an integral part. However, it goes beyond and includes additional product elements which contribute to ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation to support our customers in their transition. We define a Sustainable (P&C

insurance) Solution as an insurance product or service that substantially contributes to climate change adaptation and to one or more further environmental, social, or governance objectives, without doing significant harm to any of the other objectives, while being in line with the principles of Minimum Safeguards and hence supporting our customers in transitioning toward an environmentally or socially sustainable way of doing business or living.

To ensure compliance across the Allianz Group, the Sustainable Solutions framework is codified in internal policies and applies as a harmonized and mandatory framework for all Allianz P&C entities, including a certification process for sustainable products and services. Eligible objectives and suitable product elements have been predefined. They were derived from the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation – where available1 – and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and can be summarized as follows:

Environmental objectives

− Climate change mitigation: avoid, reduce, or remove GHG emissions.

− Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: contribute to good status of water bodies.

− Transition to a circular economy: promote durability, re-use, and recycling.

− Pollution prevention and control: improve quality of air, water, and land.

− Protection, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.

Social objectives

− Encourage and expand access to insurance and services for helpers or socially disadvantaged groups.

− Foster socially responsible behavior or engagement.

1_The Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework applies to all P&C insurance LoBs.

114 E.U. Taxonomy Regulation

In 2024, we generated € 4,915 mn revenues from certified Sustainable Solutions increase of € 1,889 mn in 2024 (2023: € 3,026 mn). Hence, the Sustainable Solutions framework continues to contribute to our overall purpose: We secure your future.

Ensure implementation into our business

Our Sustainable Solutions framework and its application have been integrated into the binding Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU), which governs the rules and principles for P&C underwriting within the Allianz Group and is an integral part of the overall Group risk architecture as described in the Allianz Group Risk Policy.

As of January 2023, all newly developed products and services must be assessed and classified under the Sustainable Solutions framework in the product development process by our operating entities. Results are validated by a dedicated function within our Group Center Global P&C, which has the responsibility to approve or not approve submitted products as sustainable and issue a respective certification in case of approval.

In addition, as of January 2024, products or services may only be labeled, advertised, or in any other way promoted as Sustainable Solutions (or any other term that implies the sustainability of a solution, such as “green” or “social”), if the product or service is certified under our Sustainable Solutions framework.

Allianz’s actions and measurements

The Sustainable Solutions framework incorporates material ESG objectives into P&C decision-making and portfolio management processes. We aim to shift our product portfolio toward sustainable products by using the Sustainable Solutions framework as guiding considerations in the product development process.

Offering insurance cover for climate-related perils has always been a key provision by Allianz. Still, closing the insurance protection gap remains a major challenge in many markets. To increase the penetration rate of covers for natural catastrophes, our product strategy is moving toward coverage for natural catastrophes per default (with opt-out elements).

To manage climate-related risks adequately, we are continuously improving our risk and pricing models by integrating the latest data and information on climate change impacts through forward-looking NatCat scenarios and global hazard maps. However, effective adaptation to climate change not only requires adequate pricing of

risks, but also individual measures by customers. We have therefore started considering preventative actions taken by the customer in our products and pricing models. Living up to our role as a climate risk manager, we are also integrating advisory services into our customer communication and we provide relevant information to customers, for example, on how to build stronger resilience to climate-related events. In addition, we are committed to offering comprehensive insurance products for low-carbon technologies – such as battery electric vehicles (BEV) and the related ecosystem – as well as for renewable energy technologies, to support the transition of our customers toward more environment-friendly solutions. For instance, Allianz entities offer BEV insurance products, which meet the specific needs of the new ecosystem such as range anxiety, comprehensive coverage of accessory equipment, and coverage for battery disposal. Within our commercial energy and construction business, we offer insurance to cover the setup, installation, and operation of renewable energy projects such as solar and wind farms, both onshore and offshore.

Material ESG objectives are also considered in our claims processes. We have started integrating environmental standards into our claims processes by encouraging or incentivizing our customers, car repair shops, and manufacturers to repair instead of replacing or using refurbished parts, where possible. Moreover, we started increasing our claims payments to our customers to not only rebuild damaged assets such as buildings, but to use more sustainable or energy-efficient building materials or elements (build back better), as well as building more resilience to the adverse effects of climate change (build back stronger).

Allianz’s ambition

Our ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and investee companies across different sectors in their transition to net-zero, as well as to support our customers in their transition to environmentally friendly choices.

Since the financial year 2024, we have incorporated quantitative targets into the remuneration scheme of the Board of Management and CEOs of our operating entities to accelerate further growth of Sustainable Solutions revenues.

E.U. Taxonomy Regulation for non-life treaty reinsurance

E.U. Taxonomy eligibility

For the calculation of E.U. Taxonomy-eligible premium from our reinsurance activities, the same approach as for non-life underwriting activities is used.

E.U. Taxonomy alignment

We identify the share of E.U. Taxonomy-aligned premiums by applying the relevant Technical Screening Criteria for reinsurance to our book of eligible reinsurance premiums. We limit the reported share to the premium generated through the coverage of climate-related perils.

Modelling and pricing of climate risks

For the modelling of our reinsurance treaty portfolio, we use the same Nat Cat models as for our primary book of business.

Do no significant harm (“DNSH”) - Climate change mitigation

To ensure that our reinsurance treaty activities reported as E.U. Taxonomy-aligned do not significantly harm climate change mitigation, we deduct revenues related to the extraction, storage, transport, or manufacture of fossil fuels, as well as vehicles, property, or other assets dedicated to such purposes.

conservative approach is taken and no revenues from the respective treaty are considered as aligned.

Minimum Safeguards

Compliance with the Minimum Safeguards Criteria is ensured by adhering to the Allianz Group Standards regarding the integration of sustainability in business decisions. We perform regular screening of our reinsurance treaty clients using internal and external information sources.

Overall results of E.U. Taxonomy Screening

We are reporting a relatively low share of Taxonomy-aligned revenues due to the limitation to only report climate related peril share in the premiums and our conservative approach to exclude revenues when no information about fossil fuel-related exposure for a portfolio is available.

Definitions for E.U. Taxonomy non-life (re)insurance

Data collection is conducted in the Solvency II P&C LoB reporting is based on non-consolidated LoB infrastructure. reporting. Information

Definition of premiums

In line with the requirements that are set forth by the E.U. Taxonomy, Allianz follows the principle of using figures as premium base that relate to financial reporting and are communicated externally through Allianz financial statements – Total Business Volume (TBV). TBV presents a measure for the overall amount of business generated during a specific reporting period. As TBV by itself does not represent a premium related to the insurance coverage (it also includes fee and commission income), the following adjustment has been performed: As fee and commission income are not directly linked to the provision of insurance coverage, they are eliminated to arrive at the coverage related premium figure.

This premium figure represents the required gross written premiums level.

Determination of (retro-)ceded premium share

For natural catastrophe events, Allianz Group subsidiaries transfer a portion of their business and associated risks to Allianz SE Reinsurance through internal reinsurance agreements. Allianz SE Reinsurance pools this business and, along with the net retained business of these local entities, manages the risk using external reinsurance purchased centrally on behalf of Allianz SE.

Le tableau présente une répartition des primes d'assurance et de réassurance non-vie selon leur alignement avec la taxonomie environnementale. Les activités sont classées en trois catégories principales : 

1. **Activités alignées avec la taxonomie environnementale (A.1)** :
   - Ces activités représentent 967,5 millions d'euros en 2024, soit 1,1 % des primes totales, contre 0,9 % en 2023.
   - Une partie de ces primes est réassurée (144,4 millions d'euros, soit 0,2 % des primes totales).
   - Les activités provenant de la réassurance s'élèvent à 59,7 millions d'euros (0,1 %), dont une petite fraction est réassurée (3,3 millions d'euros).

2. **Activités éligibles à la taxonomie mais non alignées (A.2)** :
   - Ces activités représentent la majorité des primes, soit 65,719 millions d'euros en 2024 (76,6 % des primes totales), contre 76,3 % en 2023.

3. **Activités non éligibles à la taxonomie (B)** :
   - Ces activités totalisent 19,139,9 millions d'euros en 2024, soit 22,3 % des primes totales, contre 22,8 % en 2023.

Les colonnes "DNSH" (Do Not Significant Harm) indiquent que les activités alignées avec la taxonomie respectent les critères environnementaux pour l'atténuation du changement climatique, les ressources marines et aquatiques, l'économie circulaire, la pollution, la biodiversité et les écosystèmes, ainsi que les garanties minimales.

E.U. Taxonomy for proprietary investments

Scope of application and methodology

For investments, the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation currently limits the scope of financial investments that can be considered as “Taxonomy- eligible” to exposures to undertakings that are obliged to publish non- financial information pursuant to Article 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. This means that, for Taxonomy reporting as an investor in other undertakings, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are obliged to disclose under Article 8 of the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation. Where the Allianz Group fully controls a non-financial investment – including real estate – the scope is not limited in that regard.

The eligibility and alignment share includes activities of controlled subsidiaries, NFRD-related investments, and non-NFRD funds that may have underlying NFRD investments or non-financial assets. For controlled investments and mortgages with property as collateral, Allianz has three main asset classes: real estate held for investment, commercial and retail mortgages, and renewable investments. Allianz’s minority interest investments in investees are mostly through publicly listed stocks and bonds. Eligibility for Allianz’s controlled assets

has been determined for all six environmental objectives that are listed in the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation. Alignment reporting is produced for the two published environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.

As in 2023, all real estate asset classes including mortgages are considered 100 % eligible, with the addition in 2024 of joint ventures in real estate. For further information, please refer to the section Changes to proprietary investment reporting. Eligibility (and alignment) for Allianz investments in investees is attained via reported data provided by MSCI ESG Research LLC.

The focus of Taxonomy reporting for 2024 is alignment, which is a step beyond eligibility. For an asset to be aligned, three steps are necessary: the substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives in line with specific Technical Screening Criteria, meeting the DNSH criteria (related to the other environmental objectives), and meeting the Minimum Safeguards criteria. Naturally, eligibility is a prerequisite for alignment.

Alignment screening relates to the first two climate change objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. Allianz has attained a relatively low alignment quota from screening our own portfolio. The main constraints included a lack of data availability for commercial mortgages and a lack of comparative data for real estate held for investment (typically for Energy Performance

Certificates determined on demand data that could not be benchmarked to the top 15 % of local real estate stock).

For the mortgage loan portfolio Allianz uses a third-party provider (SkenData) to collect the necessary EPC data to perform the alignment assessment on building level. The DNSH criteria considers both the exposure and vulnerability (after considering climate change mitigation). Overall risk materiality is then determined for each building jointly assessing the said factors. The real estate object can only be considered Taxonomy-aligned if such risk is classified as low or medium.

The Allianz Group uses only reported data for listed assets (no estimated data is used). For single listed asset products, Allianz employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at issuer level. If reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent level data is sourced. If that is unavailable, Allianz uses reported data from the ultimate group parent entity. Taxonomy-alignment is considered only for NFRD companies that publish reported data. The data hierarchy logic is suppressed for investment funds. For further information, please refer to the section Limitations of reported numbers.

renewable investments. The total alignment KPI based on CAPEX is determined in the same way.

For investments, a look-through approach applies for investment funds and unit-linked products. However, such reporting for the financial year 2024 is limited due to a lack of available data at issuer level. For further information, please refer to the section Limitations of reported numbers.

For investment funds, Allianz uses a fund look-through approach where possible to report fund eligibility and alignment, leveraging data in the Tripartite Template (TPT). However, look-through coverage of holdings was still limited for 2024 due to the inability to obtain underlying investment eligibility. Going forward, Allianz aims to expand the look-through capability for investment funds.

For 2024, Allianz has followed the disclosure guidance for insurer investment KPIs detailed in Annex IX/X of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (Disclosure Delegated Act). As mentioned earlier, the main changes regarding the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 are the introduction of alignment KPIs (by turnover and CAPEX) and the separate tables required for nuclear/gas exposures.

Allianz complies with the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation by reporting the respective Taxonomy KPIs. For investments, these numbers give us a technical view on the current status of our investment portfolio with regards to their Taxonomy-alignment. At this stage, the E.U. Taxonomy investment criteria is not used for business or investment steering purposes. However, we continue to monitor the evolution of the Taxonomy Regulation to cover further sectors of the economy and become a tool for portfolio steering in the future.

Changes to proprietary investment reporting

For Taxonomy reporting in 2024, there were some changes to how Allianz presents its numbers.

The first change relates to the exclusion of investments which do not meet the IFRS definition of cash and cash equivalents (mainly cash deposits with a maturity between 3 months and one year or cash collaterals received on securities borrowing) but are considered as cash equivalents by Allianz as these investments will never deploy a Taxonomy-aligned activity. After reassessing the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation, Allianz has determined that cash and cash equivalents should not be included in the scope of assets covered by the investment KPI. Annex X of the Disclosure Delegated Act defines in- scope assets of insurance and reinsurance undertakings as “all direct and in collective including investment undertakings and participations, loans and mortgages, property, plant and equipment, as well as, where relevant, intangibles.” Cash and cash equivalents are specifically not included in the scope of assets covered by the investment KPI. This view is affirmed by EIOPA’s technical advice on key performance indicators under Article 8 of the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation of 26 February 2021 (EIOPA-21-184).

Nuclear and Gas Delegated act

In addition, as part of the 2024 Taxonomy reporting, Allianz is required to disclose its exposure to the six nuclear and gas activities stipulated in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 (Annex III). This disclosure seeks to elicit the portion of aligned investments that are a result of the stated activities. For 2024, Allianz’s exposure to nuclear and gas activities is considered very small (around 3 % of aligned assets for turnover and CAPEX based on total alignment figures). The eligible turnover based exposure of all other objectives beside climate change is around 2 % in 2024.

Reporting about third-party asset management

Allianz took the decision to de-scope third-party asset management from E.U. Taxonomy investment reporting, in line with current market practice and our interpretation of existing regulatory requirements for 2024 reporting.

The second change relates to the renewables portfolio of the United States based SPVs. Those investments are 100 % eligible and have a high degree of alignment but have not been considered in 2023 reporting due to incomplete data at the time of reporting.

Calculation of KPIs

The main alignment KPIs for 2024 include alignment based on turnover and alignment based on CAPEX. For our financial investments, each KPI is determined using only reported data for the investee. If, for example, Allianz has an investment in a company with a turnover alignment of 10 % and the book value of the investment is 100, Allianz would report a turnover alignment balance of 10. If Allianz has covered assets of 200, then the final alignment share based on turnover would be 10/200, or 5 %. The total alignment based on turnover additionally includes alignment shares from Allianz’s own investment real estate held for investment, retail mortgages and

Finally, Allianz considered investments in real estate funds to be 100 % eligible on the basis that the majority of the underlying investments were in real estate. In 2024, Allianz determined that, by the same logic, its joint venture real estate investments should also be 100 % eligible. The impact of this reassessment leads to a higher reclassification from non-eligible to eligible for this asset class for 2024.

Sustainability matters

Opportunities

S1 Own workforce

– Adverse impact + Positive impact Material and strategic focus Material Not material

Positive impacts in our own operations are created through Allianz practices ensuring adequate working conditions, particularly by means of employee engagement, training, learning, and personal development. We have a strong focus on equal treatment and opportunities for all; this encompasses diversity, inclusion, and talent acquisition and retention. The health and well-being of our employees continues to be an area of focus – our practices typically include offering flexibility in working time, paying competitive wages, and fostering freedom of association and dialogue with our employees. Furthermore, securing the confidentiality of employee data is key for us. By implementing these and further practices – including annual risk assessments, as applicable, regarding the protection of human/employee rights in accordance with the GSCA – we continue to work to ensure (potential/actual) adverse impacts are prevented and reduced. All the people in Allianz own workforce are in scope of the Allianz CSRD DMA.

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long- term)

In contrast to the positive impact of our strategic priorities on individual employees, the inadequate implementation of our strategy could expose Allianz to various risks in our own operations. For example, Allianz’s ability to attract and retain talent could be compromised if it fails to enhance sustainability matters such as “Working conditions”, “Equal treatment and opportunities for all”, and targeted ESG-related training programs. Furthermore, this situation could lead to enduring reputational harm, negative publicity, loss of trust, and legal disputes. Any deviation from our values expressed in our People and Culture strategy could elicit disapproval from various stakeholders, potentially resulting in increased legal costs and financial repercussions for Allianz. Moreover, employees who perceive a lack of social protection may suffer from stress, financial insecurity, reduced job satisfaction, and diminished productivity. Additionally, Allianz and its employees may face challenges in effectively embracing new technologies, such as AI, which could amplify the risk of errors and losses.

Risks

We see material opportunities associated with our own operations, in that the practices that facilitate our positive impacts – i.e., practices ensuring adequate working conditions as well as training and skills development – allow us to attract and retain talent as a key success factor for our business.

Opportunities




Group People and Culture strategy – Related impacts, risks, and opportunities

Our strategy details how we manage and support our workforce with the ambition of being the top employer in the financial services industry globally. Our policies emphasize fair treatment, diversity and inclusion, and lifelong learning, all aimed at fostering an environment where every employee feels valued and respected. Our strategy involves setting clear targets for employee engagement, development, and gender and generational diversity as further outlined below. Key actions include conducting regular employee engagement surveys, offering various training programs, establishing multiple exchange forums, networks, and partnerships to promote inclusivity, and enhancing an Occupational Health and Safety Management system, as further outlined below.

To reach our ambition, we have based our Group People and Culture strategy on three pillars:

− Employees and candidates: We ensure an engaging, motivating, and inclusive environment in which both people and performance matter, where we create development and growth opportunities for employees and put measures in place to retain them (see the section Engaging with own workforce). This includes a focus on life- long learning, (see the section Learning and development and performance management), fair remuneration, as well as health and safety for our employees (see the sections Fair remuneration

Our People and Culture ambition is based on our corporate purpose “We secure your future”. Based on this commitment, we aim to be the top employer in the financial services industry globally. We focus on placing customers and our 154,346 employees1 (see table S1-6.1 in the section Characteristics of our employees) at the core of our business.

and Social protection and health and safety). We also focus on talent acquisition and the hiring of internal and external talents where a positive candidate experience during the recruiting and onboarding process is of utmost importance to us.

− Business: To support our business in the best possible manner, a key focus is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. A diverse workforce enables us to better understand and fulfill the needs of our equally diverse customer base. We foster an inclusive culture, and we are committed to providing equal opportunities for all. We aim to ensure there is no discrimination for reasons including gender, age, mental or physical abilities, nationalities/ethnicities, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or social background (see the section DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)).

− Brand and Society: We contribute to our corporate purpose with our commitment to our brand and society. Our contribution to our brand is verified and acknowledged by external certifications like Great Place to Work® (GPTW; see the section Engaging with own workforce) and EDGE1, as well as global rankings like the FTSE D&I Index 2. Regarding society, we support employee volunteering and initiatives, such as financial literacy programs. We also engage with the WEF, for instance, as a member of the Good Work Alliance for a more resilient, inclusive, and humane future of work. Our People and Culture work contributes to promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth and helps to deliver on UN SDG 8 (“Decent work and Economic growth”).

For further information, please refer to our People Fact Book 2024.

When we execute our strategy successfully and create an engaging and inclusive environment, we expect this to have a positive impact on our employees. For example, the first pillar of our strategy contributes to a positive impact on “Working conditions,” while the second pillar contributes to “Equal treatment and opportunity for all”. Poor strategy implementation could expose Allianz to risks like limited ability to attract and retain talent and reputational risks. We recognize these risks and have implemented various mitigation actions and initiatives to address them; an overview can be found in the section Taking action on material impacts, risks, and opportunities. Allianz’s ability to act on business opportunities is strengthened if we employ and retain skilled and engaged top talent whom we support in their development.

Policies related to own workforce

Policies are instrumental in implementing our Group People and Culture strategy as they constitute the framework of our management principles that we apply to our decision-making. We consider our established Allianz Corporate Rules as policies in the meaning of ESRS. The policies described below are all published in the Allianz Corporate Rules Book. For a general description of the Allianz Corporate Rules Book, please refer to the section Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies.

The Allianz Group Code of Conduct reflects our overall values and principles, providing guidance to our employees in their actions and decisions, and applies to the entire Allianz Group. It emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as the health and safety of our employees, and commits to zero tolerance for discrimination, bullying, or harassment. For further information on the Allianz Group Code of Conduct, please refer to the section Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies.

The Allianz Standard for People and Culture (ASPC) establishes principles for People and Culture management and specifies the roles and responsibilities of the respective Group People and Culture functions. The Standard applies to the Allianz Group, except for Allianz Asset Management subsidiaries, which are covered by separate standards aligned with the general principles outlined in the ASPC. People and Culture regularly monitors the implementation of the Standard, including central reviews of compliance, self-assessment completed by subsidiaries, issue identification, reporting, remediation, and closure.

The Allianz Group Remuneration Policy establishes general and the entire specific compensation principles and applies Allianz Group. It defines processes related to performance evaluation, the remuneration system (including remuneration plans), and corresponding roles and responsibilities. The implementation of the policy is guided by the principle of proportionality, taking into account the nature of business, size, complexity, and regulatory environment of the respective subsidiary. This principle of proportionality only applies to the “how” and not to the “if” of the implementation. Each subsidiary is obliged to provide a Statement of Accountability to Allianz SE

management to confirm the local implementation of the Group Remuneration Policy.

In addition to the zero-tolerance policy toward discrimination included in the Allianz Group Code of Conduct, the Allianz Functional Rule for Human Rights Due Diligence in Own Operations reflects our further obligations to manage risks to the human rights of our employees, including equal treatment, occupational health and safety, freedom of association, and living wages, as well as the prohibition of child and forced labor. Employees are treated equally, regardless of national or ethnic origin, social origin, health status, disability, sexual orientation, age, gender, religious beliefs, or any other protected characteristic. The Allianz Functional Rule for Human Rights Due Diligence in Own Operations applies to the entire Allianz Group except for certain subsidiaries, which are covered by separate standards aligned with the general principles. We support and respect international human rights as outlined in the International Bill of Human Rights and the core International Labor Organization Convention. Our due diligence processes in own operations comply with the requirements of the GSCA, aligned with the UNGPs. For further information, please refer to the sections Integrating sustainability in Allianz own operations, Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue, and Human rights in own workforce.

If the ASPC, Group Remuneration Policy, and Allianz Functional Rule for Human Rights Due Diligence in Own Operations, or single items within them are in conflict with local law or regulations, the local law or regulations will prevail. These policies are reviewed once a year taking into account legal requirements and the interests of key stakeholders such as the Allianz SE Group Centers 3. Material changes to the ASPC must be approved by the Allianz SE Board member with overall responsibility for People and Culture, who is also the owner of this Standard. The ASPC was updated in 2024 to align with the requirements of ESRS and the GSCA, among others. Any revisions of the Group Remuneration Policy must be approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management. All material changes to the Allianz Functional Rule for Human Rights Due Diligence in Own Operations must be approved by the Chief People and Culture Officer.

(APS) establishes global requirements for the proper handling of personal data, including that of our employees. For further details, please refer to the section Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies.

1_Within the Asset Management segment, Allianz Asset Management Holding and AllianzGI are included. 2_The upper limit of the IMIX index is 100%. The target increase for 2025 reflects the positive developments of the index in the past and must be newly achieved based on the new survey. 3_Based on information from all subsidiaries using the leading People and Culture IT system. Excluding inactive employees as well as employees excluded due to local subsidiary agreements or legal reasons. Additionally, temporary employees and Allianz Partners Platform population are excluded only

for the Allianz non-executive population.

4_Allianz Asset Management subsidiaries only reported data for gender and generations KPI. For gender, only roles considered comparable to AGE cluster are included, as the Allianz Global Grading System is not applicable. 5_Global targets on gender representation and generational representation are set where permissible per local law. 6_Refinement of methodology in 2024 by including executives on unpaid parental leave. 7_From 2025, we will shift from the "Women in Leadership" KPI, focused on executive positions, to "Gender Balance in Leadership", encompassing all employees with at least one direct report (excluding trainees and working students). This broader scope ensures a more accurate reflection of

leadership/management across all levels.

122 S1 Own Workforce

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

The Allianz SE Board of Management sets the targets with input from Group People and Culture and other relevant stakeholders.

Group People and Culture regularly monitors and reports the progress toward meeting the targets to the Allianz SE Board of Management: annually on the employee listening indices Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) and Work Well Index+ (WWI+) and biannually on gender representation, generational diversity, learning hours, and Personal Development Plans (PDP). Group People and Culture and subsidiaries set up their global/individual local action plans to reach their targets informed by the regular reporting. For further information on the Allianz SE Board of Management target- setting process, please refer to the Board of Management target process section.

The targets outlined in table S1-5 are based on our strategic priorities and set for specific material sustainability matters. For further material sustainability matters without an explicit target, we focus our efforts on the established policy framework. The effectiveness of our policies is tracked via the Corporate Rules Book process. For further details, please refer to the Policies related to own workforce and Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies sections. For further details regarding the effectiveness of our actions, please refer to the respective sections.

Taking action on material impacts, risks, and opportunities

We implement specific actions, managed by dedicated Group People and Culture functions, to act on material impacts, mitigate material risks, and pursue material opportunities (see the section Group People and Culture strategy - Related impacts, risks, and opportunities).

1_Employees in Allianz’s subsidiaries which fully report under the global People and Culture metrics definition handbook (incl. all insurance and asset management business). Contracted headcount working at consolidated Allianz Group subsidiaries: 156,626.

123 S1 Own Workforce

These actions are outlined in the remaining sections:

− Characteristics of our employees, − Processes for engaging with our own workforce, − DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), − Learning and development and performance management, − Fair remuneration, − Human rights in own workforce, − Social protection and health and safety.

The structure of the sections in the remainder of “S1 Own workforce” generally adheres to the Policies – Actions – Targets logic.

Characteristics of our employees

As outlined in the ASPC, the metrics in the section S1 Own workforce are centrally collected by the Allianz Group People and Culture function according to global standards, with definitions documented in the People and Culture metrics definition handbook and regularly reported to the Allianz SE Board of Management.

As of 31 December 2024, 154,346 employees 1 hold an employment contract with Allianz (for more information on the number of employees, please see table S1-6.1 and refer to note 8.18 to the consolidated financial statements). This contracted headcount figure serves as the basis for the KPIs in the section S1 Own workforce. The breakdown of employees by reportable segments in tables S1-6.2 and S1-6.4 reflects the Allianz Group structure and ensures consistency throughout the Annual Report. Germany is displayed separately as most employees are in this country. For further information, please refer to the Business Operations chapter.

Table S1-6.3 shows that most of our employees hold permanent contracts, with temporary contracts occasionally offered to new employees before permanent employment. The latter affects in particular seasonal workers to meet customer demands or career entrants for summer internships in certain subsidiaries. A small number of employees, such as medical professionals or working students, have non-guaranteed hours and salary. While most employees work full-

time, various employees make use of the flexibility that we offer through part-time employment.

Engaging with own workforce

Listening to and engaging with our employees are the cornerstones of implementing our People and Culture strategy. As outlined in the ASPC, the Allianz SE Board Member in charge of People and Culture sets the People and Culture strategy, which includes the approach to listening to our employees. The global Chief People and Culture Officer is responsible for the implementation of the People and Culture strategy with the support of local People and Culture Directors.

The Allianz Engagement Survey (AES) has been our platform for gathering employee feedback globally since 2010. The survey measures two key indicators: the IMIX and the WWI+. 1 The IMIX measures our progress in building a culture where both people and performance matter. In 2024, the IMIX increased by 2 percentage points to 83 % (2023: 81 %). Improvements in IMIX scores show progress leadership, performance, and corporate culture. The WWI+ in measures employee well-being, health and safety, and our learning efforts. in our WWI+ score demonstrate higher employee well-being. The WWI+ score increased by 3 percentage points to 79 % (2023: 76 %), a significant step up which underlines our continuous focus on our people’s health and well-being. For further information, please refer to the section Health and safety.

Each participating Allianz subsidiary analyzes its results to gain insights and agrees on action plans to address learnings from the survey with their teams. Common themes are then addressed in a

global follow-up plan. For example, in 2024, we focused on learning and development by implementing global training initiatives to strengthen our employees’ digital and data skills in areas like artificial intelligence, as outlined in the section Learning and development and performance management.

In addition to the AES, we run biannual global Pulse surveys to assess the progress of all AES measures and their implementations.

The AES results are monitored and reported annually to the Allianz SE Board of management and are directly linked to their performance targets. In 2024, we aim to achieve an IMIX score above 75 % and a positive WWI+ development against previous year and our level (see table S1-5), which we successfully overall ambition accomplished.

Our strong focus on listening to our employees has been recognized with awards and certifications. Allianz ranks #17 among the “World’s Best Workplaces 2024™” and #7 on Fortune's "100 Best Companies to Work For in Europe 2024™”, both certifications provided by GPTW®.

We protect employee rights through Europe-wide standards, ensuring the effective representation of our own workforce at the European level and endorsing the establishment of employee representatives at information on additional processes for engaging with our workforce via employee representatives, please refer to the section Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue.

For information on our global complaints mechanism to allow our employees to raise concerns, please refer to the section Human rights in own workforce.

DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)

This section includes disclosures relevant to our DEI strategy, including the strategic sub-sections Gender, Generations as well as Persons with disabilities and disclosures relevant to the ESRS S1 Own workforce sustainability matter “Equal treatment and opportunity for all”.

DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)

DEI is a core element in helping our business to fulfill and meet the needs of our equally diverse customer base. We also know that diverse teams yield better results, show higher resilience, and drive innovation and productivity. Central to achieving this is creating an inclusive

culture where all our employees can be themselves and unique views are appreciated and respected.

We therefore strengthen DEI in our workplace by fostering an inclusive culture, ensuring equal opportunities, and shaping a diverse workforce along five core dimensions: gender, generations, persons with disabilities, nationalities/ethnicities, and LGBTQ+. With our ASPC, we aim to ensure there is no discrimination for reasons including gender, age, mental or physical abilities, nationalities/ethnicities, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or social background. The Standard and our Allianz Group Code of Conduct also outline our global zero-tolerance approach to harassment (including but not limited to sexual harassment) and discrimination. We encourage employees to speak up in line with our open communication and feedback culture and to use the Allianz Group’s whistleblowing tool should they become aware of violations of our Allianz Group Code of Conduct. Please refer to the sections Human rights in own workforce and Corruption and bribery for further information.

We have implemented multiple exchange forums and networks with dedicated actions to strengthen inclusivity, such as:

− Our Global Inclusion Council (GIC), in place since 2007, oversees the DEI strategy implementation. It consists of over 30 Allianz senior leaders from our subsidiaries, Allianz Group Center representatives, and global DEI employee network leads, meeting at least three times per year.

− Our DEI Employee Networks have served as strong employee advocate groups since 2018 by representing the voices of our employees and helping us engage with them and understand what matters. They raise awareness, support employees, advocate for change, and shape the agenda for DEI. We have five global employee networks: “Allianz NEO” for gender inclusion, “Allianz Beyond” for inclusion of persons with disabilities, “Allianz GRACE” for ethnicity and cultural for generational inclusion, and “Allianz Pride” for LGBTQ+ inclusion. Each network is supported by two senior business sponsors and has a global board that meets on a regular basis to discuss network activities. In 2024, our total number of employee networks is 94.

Gender

At Allianz, we have already attained overall numerical parity of women and men in our workforce (see table S1-6.1). The ASPC includes the principles with which gender representation is managed in the Allianz Group.

Our actions for higher inclusion help us achieve our targets on gender. These include:

− We put measures in place to staff leadership positions with the most suitable candidates, ensuring equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender.

− We promote equal pay for equal work in the same or comparable work for all genders.

− Allianz NEO, our employee network for gender inclusion, has 21 local networks in place, with one of those launched in 2024.

We regularly monitor and report the percentage of our female executives to the Allianz SE Board of Management. Our 2024 targets are to have 30 % women in Allianz Global Executive positions, 30 % women in Allianz Senior Executive positions, and 40 % women in Allianz Executive positions. 1 The targets are set and calibrated every

Generations

We are committed to leveraging the combined strengths, individual skills, and experiences of all five generations working together at Allianz.

The ASPC includes the principles with which generations are managed in Allianz Group.

Our actions for generational diversity include supporting life-long learning and knowledge transfer between generations, such as inter- generational mentors for new joiners.

Allianz Engage, our network for generational diversity, supports age-diverse their management, bringing varied experiences and mindsets into the organization with a positive business impact. The network has 15 chapters in place, with four of those launched in 2024.

We regularly monitor and report our generational diversity to the Allianz SE Board of Management. We aim to have a balanced generational representation where at least 25 % of our workforce is younger than 35 years old (Generation Z and Generation Y) in 2024.2 The 2024 age ratios are detailed in table S1-9.2.

Persons with disabilities

We prioritize the health and well-being of our employees as outlined in the ASPC. Each subsidiary needs to adhere to specific and varying local legal definitions and measurement criteria for disability. Therefore, concrete actions and initiatives are steered and executed locally and monitored and reported globally.

In addition, to support our employees who are persons with disabilities, we put global actions in place, including:

− Allianz Beyond, our employee network for inclusion of persons with disabilities, currently has 16 local networks in place, including four local networks launched in 2024. It focuses on raising awareness of the inclusion of persons with disabilities and identifying ways to enhance physical and digital accessibility within Allianz. This includes, for example, ensuring that our workplaces are equally accessible irrespective of a possible disability. It aims at creating a safe space for employees to disclose their disability and voice their workplace support requirements to perform at their best. Additionally, it promotes Allianz externally as an attractive employer for persons with disabilities. The global Beyond board meets on a regular basis to discuss network activities. Allianz has been a Valuable 500 member since 2020 and is committed to increasing transparency on disabilities in the

These were in 2023 and cover the following announced at the WEF dimensions: Workforce Representation, Training, Employee Resource Groups, and Digital Accessibility. We are working with Valuable 500 to secure commitment from other members to disclose Disability Inclusion KPIs and ultimately grant persons with disabilities more equity in the workplace.

Training and skills development

Our ambition is to offer training and development opportunities to prepare employees for today and the future, ensuring Allianz is prepared for emerging trends and opportunities and able to attract the top talent. Lifelong learning is guided by the principles outlined in the ASPC.

Our global focus skills in 2024 comprise IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and EQ (Emotional Quotient) related skills and are relevant for all employees and leaders. The IQ skills encompass digital and data skills, business and problem-solving, sustainability, and leadership skills while the EQ category focuses on curiosity, resilience, “we mentality”, and flexibility.

We employ various learning and development approaches including on-the-job learning, coaching, classroom training, peer circles, and digital learning, all supported by our digital learning platform, Degreed.

In 2024, we focused on digital and data skills, introducing AI learning opportunities to all leaders and employees. We offered three global initiatives: “Fit4IT” (focuses on digital tools, AI, data, and technological trends), “DataXcellence” (improves data literacy and analytics through three certification levels), and the “AI Run” (upskills in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and prompting through a 12- week learning journey suitable for beginners and experts).

In accordance with the applicability of the ASPC, for people leaders, we keep ensuring they obtain or refresh the #lead Allianz Leadership Passport, which is the “license” to be a people leader at Allianz globally. The program sets minimum standards for all people leaders, with an equal focus on IQ and EQ. After obtaining their Leadership Passport, leaders must refresh their passports on a yearly basis with continuous learning.

In addition, we run five global leadership transition programs every year, with each program addressing a specific leadership transition, from new leaders to future board members.

To support our employees in their growth and development, we offer them a minimum of one hour working time per week dedicated to learning and development1 which amounts to a global target of a minimum average of 43 hours of training per employee per year. This target is included in the Allianz SE Board of Management targets. For further details, please refer to the section Targets related to own workforce. Group People and Culture regularly monitors and reports the take up and refresh of the #lead passport, the five global #lead programs, as well as the learning hours per employee to the Allianz SE

Performance management and career development

At Allianz we are equally committed to growth opportunities for our people through performance management and career development. The ongoing performance management process is intended to enhance employees’ individual performance.

The framework which governs performance management is the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy.

Our performance management review process begins with priority-setting in the first quarter of the performance year, establishing clear, flexible goals and desired behaviors. It includes a mid-year check-in supported by Multi-Rater feedback, which gathers 360-degree feedback, for continuous performance improvement1. The process concludes with a Year-End-Review to assess performance, a Performance and Talent Dialogue for fair calibration, and the communication of the final Individual Performance Assessment to align achievements and development areas in Q1 of the following year. The participation in the Performance Management review process is displayed in table S1-13.2.

The consistent application of the key steps of the performance management cycle is enabled via the global People and Culture template, which is available for both executive and non-executive employees. The Group People and Culture function oversees the performance management template and process within the central People and Culture IT system and ensures that the template is accessible for operational use by local subsidiaries. Execution and outcomes of the performance management process are subject to local legal regulations and respective governance bodies, e.g., local or global Compensation Committees.

implemented for executives and non-executives via our PDP, rooted in the ASPC. The PDP lays out the employee’s personal development objectives and actions agreed upon with their manager. Campaigns on the importance of personal development aim to encourage every employee to have a PDP. In local webinars and workshops, leaders are trained to have impactful development discussions and employees are empowered to create and drive their PDP. The PDP rates are monitored and reported regularly to the Board of Management. The 2024 targets for the Allianz executive population of 80 % and the non-executive population of 60 % were both achieved (see table S1-13.3). For further details, please refer to section Targets related to own workforce.

Fair Remuneration

This section includes the disclosures relevant to the strategic topic “Gender pay gap and remuneration ratio” as well as to the topics of “Adequate wages”, and “Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue”. It also covers the ESRS S1 Own workforce sustainability matter “Overall working conditions”.

Gender pay gap and remuneration ratio

We strive for equitable and fair remuneration across the organization, as defined in our Allianz Group Code of Conduct and Group Remuneration Policy.

In 2024, the entity-specific unadjusted gender pay gap is 25.2 %.1 It is defined as the difference of average pay levels between female and male employees, expressed as the percentage of the average pay level of male employees, irrespective of their role, seniority, function, or location. 2

The target total remuneration for the Allianz SE Board of Management is determined by the Allianz Supervisory Board based on a fully disclosed remuneration system approved by shareholders (see also the Remuneration Report). In 2024, the annual total remuneration ratio of the CEO 3 to the median annual total remuneration for all Allianz employees, as defined by ESRS, is 139.9.

Adequate wages

Based on the Allianz Functional Rule for Human Rights Due Diligence in Own Operations, we are committed to offering an adequate wage to our employees in line with applicable laws and benchmarks. To determine whether all employees receive adequate wages, we consider the statutory minimum wage on country level or on sub national level, where applicable. If there is no statutory minimum wage, we consider an adequate wage benchmark determined by using a living wage methodology.

Furthermore, in accordance with the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy, both internal and external benchmarking is performed to ensure the appropriateness of (individual) remuneration and general pay levels.

We pay all employees an adequate wage.

1_As disclosed in the section Basis for preparation of the Sustainability Statement, we have applied the safeguard clause according to ESRS 2.5(e) in conjunction with §§ 289e and 315c HGB to the disclosure of the gender pay gap ratio in line with ESRS S1-16.

Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue

We aim to ensure that employee rights are protected across all Allianz subsidiaries. In the “Agreement concerning the participation of employees in Allianz SE”, signed by Allianz SE Management and the (European) Allianz SE Works Council, employee participation standards were established Europe-wide.

Through the (European) Allianz SE Works Council and the regular dialogue between management, employee representatives, and their trade unions, we ensure effective representation of all its employees at European level. Our (European) Works Council Executive Committee demonstrates that we endorse the establishment of employee representatives in its subsidiaries and welcome their cooperation with the trade unions. In our pan-European forum, which has existed for over a decade, we work closely with employee representatives (members of the (European) SE Works Council’s Executive Committee and employee representatives on the Allianz SE Supervisory Board) to support the impacts on implementation of change, manage employees, and promote opportunities. This dialogue supports the progress of our business strategy, agenda, and response to the increased pace of change in topics such as the digital revolution. The (European) Allianz SE Works Council generally meets twice a year, the Executive Committee of the (European) Works Council five times, and the pan-European forum four times a year. Employee representation is widespread across Europe. The right of employees to establish employee representative bodies and thus negotiate working conditions is guaranteed by law in many jurisdictions. The mandate of employee representatives and the employer’s role regarding collective bargaining and the social dialogue is very much influenced by local legal requirements.

We support the principles included in the ILO core conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining as outlined in the Allianz Functional Rule for Human Rights Due Diligence in Own Operations. In countries where those principles have been enshrined in local law, we fully respect and implement local rules on trade unions and employee representation. In countries that have not ratified the relevant ILO conventions, we respect the primacy of local laws and look for ways to allow our employees to organize and voice their interests to the management. In compliance with the GSCA, each subsidiary in scope conducts an annual risk assessment for the rights

According to ESRS reporting requirements, the term “coverage” includes the number of employees to whom the subsidiaries concerned are obliged to apply the collective bargaining agreements. Table S1-8.2 outlines the ratio of Allianz’s employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements globally. Moreover, beyond the obligation, there are a large number of subsidiaries that apply collective bargaining agreements and provisions on a voluntary basis. The term “Social Dialogue” in relation to workplace representation includes the number of employees covered by employee representation committees. For details, please refer to tables S1-8.1 and S1-8.2.

Human rights in own workforce

Allianz recognizes the importance of human rights as both a value- based and a business issue. We see respect for human rights as a minimum standard for responsible business, both within and beyond our direct operations. For further information on our human rights commitment see our Human Rights Policy Statement.

Allianz SE, as the holding company of the Allianz Group, has been subject to the GSCA since January 2023. For our employees, the GSCA requires us to establish due diligence processes to identify, assess, and minimize human rights risks as well as to stop and mitigate violations. The effectiveness of measures is regularly reviewed. The Group Human Rights Officer monitors the effectiveness of the risk management system and regularly reports to the Allianz SE Board of Management. For our own employees, these processes are grounded in the internal Allianz Functional Rule for Human Rights Due Diligence in Own Operations and described in the public Human Rights Policy Statement.

On the basis of our risk assessments, we have identified the following human rights as the most relevant for our own workforce in the context of our business model: equal treatment, adequate wages, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and occupational health and safety. For details on our policies, actions, and targets on these specific rights, please refer to the relevant sections of S1 Own workforce and the Allianz company website.

Our official global complaints mechanism SpeakUp@Allianz gives our employees, and everyone else, the opportunity to raise concerns including risks to, and violations of, human rights. The complaints mechanism is widely promoted through the Allianz intranet and other channels, and it forms part of the global training on violation reporting under GCSA. For further information on the channel, please refer to the section Corruption and bribery.

We apply the following definition for human rights issues under ESRS:

− A complaint is any expression of dissatisfaction about a person or group. Customer complaints that are not related to potential misconduct are excluded. For further information, please refer to the section Corruption and bribery.

− An incident is a predicated and confirmed event or occurrence that is contrary to the rules as set out in Allianz´s internal rules and/or legal regulations.

− A severe human rights incident/violation is defined as follows:

131 S1 Own Workforce

− Every case of child labor. − Every case of forced labor and modern slavery, including

human trafficking.

− Every case of severe (sexual) harassment or other severe human rights violations.

Indications for a severe violation can be the number of people affected, the length of the violation, and the severity of the damage inflicted, including its reversibility. Allianz Group is committed to taking adequate and effective measures to address any confirmed incidents. We monitor our legal proceedings with our Litigation Proceedings Data Base and our Supervisory Proceedings Data Base. The Litigation Proceedings Data Base covers civil and administrative proceedings that pose reputational risks or exceed a financial threshold and criminal cases against Allianz leaders or subsidiaries. The Supervisory Proceedings Data Base includes administrative fines and administrative proceedings which could lead to administrative fines each above a specified threshold, e.g., involving employees tied to their work or internally defined sensitive issues, as well as criminal proceedings against Allianz personnel that is related to their work or against subsidiaries of the Allianz Group without a threshold. The corresponding overall amount of material fines, penalties, and compensation for incidents connected to own workforce from proceedings relating to human rights incidents registered in these data bases can be found in table S1-17.

Work-life balance

Allianz is committed to supporting parents and families in their work- life balance by offering childcare facilities, leisure activities, emergency assistance, and other family services. Family-related leave is specific to countries and usually covers maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carers’ leave. As outlined in the ASPC we strive to entitle our employees to family-related leave if it is not already provided through local social policy, collective bargaining agreements, or any other country-specific regulations. Allianz aims to exceed statutory standards where possible and appropriate.

Social protection

We operate in countries where nearly all our employees have at least access to social protection programs against loss of income due to major life events, such as sickness, unemployment, employment injury and acquired disability, parental leave, and retirement as outlined in the ASPC. Furthermore, we supplement public social security schemes, which vary by country, with additional offerings in certain countries.

Minor exceptions apply in the following cases: In countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia, not all our employees are covered against loss of income due to major life events. The main reasons are that unemployment benefits are generally not part of the social security system or there is a limitation of access to social protection for working students or interns due to local customs or unavailability in certain countries.

Health and safety

The health, safety, and physical and mental well-being of our employees is a fundamental aspect of our People and Culture strategy (see section Group People and Culture strategy – Related impacts, risks, and opportunities). We aim to maintain and enhance employee health and well-being throughout our global workforce. Two key levers to achieve this ambition are our Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management system, outlined in the ASPC and the Allianz Functional Rule for Human Rights Due Diligence in Own Operations, and our four Minimum Health Requirements.

Our global Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management system, established in 2024, is built along the following components for applicable subsidiaries:

− Dedicated GSCA Risk Experts, responsible for OHS are identified.

132 S1 Own Workforce

− Health & Safety risk assessments are conducted at least annually, covering physical safety, workplace safety, and mental health. − Action plans are defined to address medium and high risks, incl.

process tracking.

There are processes in place to ensure monitoring of these components across the Allianz Group, which are outlined in more detail in the section Human rights in own workforce. Moreover, most Allianz subsidiaries have implemented local OHS management systems to effectively address OHS matters. These systems include OHS risk and hazards assessments, dedicated action plans to mitigate these risks, and protocols for emergency actions. Internal inspections are conducted and progress in reducing and preventing health issues and risks is evaluated against set targets. This encompasses procedures for investigating work-related injuries, ill health, diseases, and incidents, and regular workforce training to enhance awareness and reduce operational health and safety incidents.

To further support employee health and well-being, Allianz established the following four Minimum Health Requirements, as applicable, in 2021:

1. Professional Support: Allianz provides employees with free-of- charge, 24/7 access to professional psychological support through its Employee Assistance Programs.

2. Leadership Enablement: Allianz offers targeted health and well- being training for people leaders through initiatives like #lead and other programs, ensuring that managers are equipped with the knowledge to sustain employee health and well-being, and to enhance resilience within their teams.

3. Employee Feedback: Employees can provide annual feedback on their health and well-being through global surveys, such as Pulse surveys. For further information, please refer to the section Engaging with own workforce.

4. Focus Time: Meeting-free calendar days have been introduced to allow most employees dedicated time to focus on their work.

The four Minimum Health Requirements are reinforced by the “Agreement on Guidelines concerning Work-Related Stress and Minimum Health Requirements” between the Allianz SE and the (European) SE Works Council of Allianz SE. This agreement is applicable to Allianz SE and its subsidiaries with registered offices in the E.U. Member States, the EEA contracting states, the U.K., and

Switzerland. Allianz is committed to implementing these minimum health requirements throughout the Allianz Group, provided it does not contravene any national legislation. Adherence to these requirements is regularly monitored.

The health and safety of our global workforce is measured via the following indicators:

− WWI+, see section Engaging with own workforce. − Pulse surveys, see section Engaging with own workforce. − The KPIs of table S1-14 which are reviewed annually. − KPIs on Employee Assistance Programs which are regularly monitored and reported to the Allianz SE Board of Management.

Opportunities

– Adverse impact + Positive impact Material and strategic focus Material Not material

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long- term)

Adverse impacts may materialize for our Property-Casualty commercial lines and proprietary investments, given our international and cross-sectoral underwriting and investment portfolios, in which potential cases of insuring and financing activities that adversely affect workers’ rights may arise. Adverse impacts on workers at our suppliers (incl. service providers relevant for our Property-Casualty retail business) may also be material, as issues related to workers’ rights cannot be excluded completely, given Allianz’ vast supplier and service provider network. In accordance with the GSCA, Allianz engages with suppliers with potential human rights (or certain environmental) risks. Allianz expects that all suppliers respect human rights and environmental regulations in their own operations and along their own supply chain.

Risks

The identified impacts have the potential to translate into risks for Allianz. The most relevant risks are reputational, resulting for instance from Allianz insuring companies/projects, investing in companies or other assets, buying from suppliers, or having its products distributed by agents that have caused or contributed to human rights violations, including severe discrimination or harassment, forced labor, child labor and harmful working conditions. As Allianz publicly supports human rights, including equal treatment and secure working conditions, violations of such rights by value chain companies could lead to public criticism and changes in the behavior of stakeholders, such as shareholders, regulators, customers, NGOs, and the media, as well as legal proceedings, resulting in increased liability claims and the potential loss of future revenues. Furthermore, operational risks, such as supply chain disruptions, may result in business disruption and financial losses for Allianz.



The section describes how Allianz’s commitment to human rights applies to the human rights and labor standards of workers in our value chain. For us, value chain workers encompass those at our suppliers, at the companies we insure and invest in, and at Allianz tied agents. For each of these stages of our value chain we have dedicated policies and actions, which are described below. They all aim to identify, assess, and mitigate risks to human rights as well as to stop and remediate human rights violations. Our complaints mechanism, NGO dialogue, and other channels allow us to engage with affected value chain workers.

Strategy and business model related to workers in the value chain Allianz is committed to supporting and respecting the protection of international human rights, as well as ensuring it is not complicit in the abuse of human rights, as outlined in the International Bill of Rights and the ILO Core Conventions. This commitment also applies to our value chain. Allianz’s due diligence approach to identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights impacts linked to business activities has been guided by the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UNGPs.

As a multinational insurance and asset management company, our value chain encompasses workers at:

− Allianz suppliers, − companies insured by Allianz, − companies that Allianz invests in as part of its proprietary

investments, and

− our tied agents responsible for distributing our products.

For the above-mentioned workers, our human rights impacts, risks, and opportunities which Allianz may cause or contribute to, or is directly linked to, are in scope.

As to impacts, there is a possibility of above-mentioned workers suffering from harmful working conditions, discriminatory treatment, or other violations of human rights or labor standards.

The human rights impact on value chain workers that Allianz may cause or contribute, or be linked to, differ depending on the stage of the value chain:

—

industries commonly associated with severe human rights risks, such as raw materials or manufacturing in certain sectors. Our materiality assessment indicates that the risks of negative impacts on workers in our supply chain are low. Insurance and proprietary investment: Allianz’s business spans many sectors and many countries globally. Therefore, there is a possibility that Allianz business may be linked to human rights impacts at companies that we insure or invest in.

independent financial services providers, most commonly organized as small or micro enterprises. Negative human rights impacts are not commonly associated with this activity.

To mitigate potential human rights impacts, we employ the policies and procedures outlined in this section. This includes channels to raise concerns and due diligence for possible impacts on workers in our value chain.

The identified impacts have the potential to translate into risks for Allianz. These risks encompass reputational, operational, consumer, and human behavior-related risk, as well as legal risks.

Allianz recognizes these risks and has implemented various mitigation actions and initiatives to address them; see section Policies related to workers in the value chain.

Policies related to workers in the value chain At Allianz, we address the management of material impacts on value chain workers through targeted due diligence processes with our business partners. An integral part of our due diligence processes across the value chain is due diligence on forced labor and child labor. In the event of identifying risks and issues, we may initiate engagement or make the decision not to collaborate with these business partners. These processes and actions are governed by different policies, depending on the specific value chain component. For our human rights commitment across the value chain, please refer to our Human Rights Policy Statement.

134 S2 Workers in the Value Chain

Given the breadth and changing nature of our global underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios and our global supply chain, Allianz is not a priori able to identify particular vulnerable groups for targeted policies. Being aware that, in certain sectors and certain countries, there is generally a heightened risk of human rights violations, we apply particular due diligence there.

The ASIS is relevant for employees at insured companies and employees at non-listed investees.

The ASIS incorporates screening and assessment criteria to proactively identify business activities that could (potentially) be linked to human rights-related impacts in the SBAs Mining, Oil & Gas, Nuclear Energy, Hydro-electric Power, Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Infrastructure, and the Sex Industry. A Sensitive Business Guideline (SBG) has been developed for each SBA, comprising criteria that assist the screening of transactions to identify potential and/or actual human rights impacts, and other sustainability issues. If negative information on impacts is identified, the referral process is triggered. In addition, screening based on a dedicated human rights guideline is required when conducting business in a country on the Sensitive Countries List (SCL). For further information on the ASIS, the referral process, and the SCL, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS Policies. From the material sustainability matters under S2, namely, “Working conditions”, “Equal treatment and opportunities for all”, and “Other work-related rights”, ASIS explores “Working conditions” and “Other work-related rights” through screening and searching for negative information about adequate wages, freedom of association or collective bargaining, child labor, forced labor, and health and safety.

Regarding the protection of the human rights of people working for our tied agents, Allianz does not have standardized Group-wide policies to manage agents and other distribution channels. Instead, we rely on local policies, which are tailored to the unique conditions and regulatory environments of each country or region.

For instance, it is common practice that a local Code of Conduct, which encompasses key points of S2, is in place for agents. This code is typically required to be signed by agents during the onboarding process, thereby embedding essential compliance measures from the outset of their engagement with Allianz. This method demonstrates that our commitment to ethical practices and human rights considerations is upheld across our global operations.

As the basis for managing impacts on workers in our supply chain, we have the Allianz Group Standard for Procurement in conjunction with the Allianz Group Vendor Code of Conduct (VCoC) in place. They cover topics such as working conditions, equal treatment and opportunities for all, other work-related rights, and child labor and forced labor, including human trafficking.

During the supplier onboarding process, suppliers registered in our standard tool for procurement are asked to comply with the VCoC or to submit a comparable code of conduct. For suppliers over a defined threshold, we apply additional checks, including questions on their human rights due diligence. This mitigates the risk of engaging with suppliers who do not uphold human rights standards.

Additional actions and processes are based on voluntary commitments as well as the requirements of the GSCA. If risks related to violations of human rights of supply chain workers are identified, we including, for example, take appropriate preventive measures, engaging with the companies in question or adding human rights- related contractual clauses to the supplier agreement. If we identify human rights violations in our supply chain, we seek to take remedial action, in line with our ability to influence suppliers. We will sever the supplier relationship as a last resort.

The FRSI describes all relevant rules, principles, and sustainability integration processes for the proprietary investment portfolio of the Allianz Group. We evaluate potential negative impacts on the workers at the investees, who we consider “workers in the value chain” in terms of ESRS S2, as part of the internal Adverse Impact Steering process and the Group Restrictions. This covers the material sustainability matters “Working conditions”, “Equal treatment and opportunities for all” and “Other work-related rights”. For more information about the FRSI, Adverse Impact Steering process, and Restrictions, refer to the section Sustainability integration.

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Targets, actions, channels to raise concerns and processes to remediate negative impacts on value chain workers Actions taken and processes implemented by Allianz to assess and address (potential) human rights impacts on value chain workers depend on the stage of the value chain, while they are all guided by the UNGPs.

For commercial insurance and non-listed proprietary investments, risk assessments and mitigating actions are governed by the ASIS, while those for our listed proprietary investments are governed by the FRSI, as described above. For the supply chain, risk assessments and mitigating actions are governed by the Allianz Group Standard for Procurement. We track the effectiveness of our actions and processes through the Corporate Rules Book process as described in the sections Policies related to workers in the value chain and Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies. Additionally, the Allianz Group Human Rights Officer monitors the effectiveness of our risk management system for the human rights of workers in our supply chain and reports to the Allianz SE Board of Management at least once a year.

Allianz has not adopted specific metrics or targets for workers in our value chain, hence there is also no timeframe for targets. This approach is adequate given the nature of our value chain – with a vast, diverse, and changing portfolio of companies we insure and invest in, and a global supply chain with very limited human rights risk (and hence limited upside for target setting). We have established comprehensive policies to prevent human rights violations that allow us to respond effectively to concerns that have been identified. For our public human rights commitment, see the Allianz Human Rights Policy Statement and the Sustainability Integration Framework.

While Allianz has not adopted a dedicated process to engage with value chain workers, human rights issues can be addressed through existing engagement channels. Everyone inside and outside Allianz can report issues related to the human rights of workers in our value chain through our independent complaints mechanism, SpeakUp@Allianz, which is further detailed in the section G1 Business conduct.

In 2024, no severe human rights violations of value chain workers were reported through SpeakUp@Alllianz.

135 S2 Workers in the Value Chain

Adverse media screenings of potentially high-risk suppliers did not produce any information on human rights violations in our supply chain in 2024. For our insurance and proprietary investment, the ASIS process is designed to prevent Allianz from insuring or investing in companies that cause severe human rights violations. We continuously monitor our portfolios to be able to address violations should they occur.

In addition, Allianz conducts regular dialogues with NGOs to discuss the potential social and environmental its operations and business, including impacts on value chain workers. This ongoing dialogue helps Allianz to stay informed about the possible impacts and to address any concerns in a proactive manner.

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long- term)

Adverse impacts may materialize for our Property-Casualty commercial lines and proprietary investments, given our international and cross-sectoral underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios, in which potential cases of insuring and financing activities that adversely affect communities’ economic, social, civil, political, and cultural rights may arise.

Regarding positive impacts in our proprietary investments, we focus on enlarging our portfolio of Sustainable Investments, which contribute to social objectives that support communities’ economic, social, cultural, or civil rights.

Risks

Our reputation is at stake if we insure or invest in companies that disregard community rights. Such actions could attract negative attention from stakeholders, such as shareholders, regulators, customers, employees, NGOs, and the media, and could lead to legal challenges and financial losses for Allianz. When companies or governments disregard the rights of communities, it can have serious repercussions, including for social stability, economic development and the country’s or company’s credit standing. For Allianz, investing in such companies, countries or projects means taking on a greater level of credit risk, which could even lead to a downgrade in our credit rating.




Section summary

Our approach with respect to the communities affected by our insurance and proprietary investment business is based on policies which include due diligence processes aimed at avoiding adverse impacts on affected communities. We are committed to supporting and respecting the protection of international human rights and further engage in regular dialogues with NGOs.

136 S3 Affected communities

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Allianz recognizes these risks and has implemented mitigation processes to address them, see section Policies related to affected communities.

Policies related to affected communities The above-mentioned due diligence processes aimed at avoiding adverse impacts on affected communities through our proprietary investments and commercial insurance portfolio are laid out in binding internal corporate rules, notably the ASIS and the FRSI. For further details on ASIS and FRSI, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS policies.

The ASIS incorporates screening and assessment criteria into our insurance underwriting and non-listed investments to proactively identify business activities that could (potentially) be linked to negative impacts on communities. Sensitive business guidelines related to negative impacts on communities have been incorporated into the following SBAs of Mining, Oil & Gas, Nuclear Energy, Hydro-electric Power, Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and Infrastructure.

In addition, screening based on a dedicated human rights guideline is required when conducting business in a country on the SCL. For further information on ASIS and the SCL, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS policies. ASIS partially covers

the material sustainability matters “Communities’ economic, social, and cultural rights” and “Rights of indigenous people” through screening and identification for negative information related to resettlement of people (including native people) and impacts on their land and water rights; absence of free, prior, and informed consent; and incidents of physical harm on affected communities in relation to resettlement.

The FRSI describes all relevant rules, principles, and sustainability integration processes for the proprietary investment portfolio of the Allianz Group. Allianz evaluates potential negative impacts on affected communities in terms of ESRS S3 as part of the internal Adverse Impact Steering process for listed assets, the referral process of ASIS for non-listed assets, and the Group Restrictions. This covers the material sustainability matters “Communities’ economic, social, and cultural rights”, “Communities’ civil and political rights”, and “Rights of indigenous peoples”. However, for some areas, e.g., “Communities’ civil and political rights”, the screening process has a strong focus on the subset of indigenous peoples. For further information about the FRSI,

Adverse Impact Steering process, and Restrictions, please refer to the section Sustainability Integration.

Targets, actions, channels to raise concerns and processes for engaging with affected communities

Allianz has general due diligence processes in place based on ASIS and the FRSI that assess impacts on affected communities. The effectiveness of our policies is tracked via the Corporate Rules Book process. For further details, please refer to the sections Policies related to affected communities and Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies.

These processes are the same ones that evaluate human rights impacts on value chain workers as described in the section S2 Workers in the Value Chain. Beyond these, there are no specific actions, metrics, or the Allianz Group.

In 2024, no severe human rights violations of affected communities were reported through SpeakUp@Alllianz.

Our engagement channels for communities are the same as for workers in the value chain, which are described in the section S2 Workers in the Value Chain.

In addition, Allianz conducts regular dialogues with NGOs as outlined in the section S2 Workers in the Value Chain including potential impacts on affected communities.

### END TABLE 


We have identified positive impacts from our insurance activities (Life/Health and Property-Casualty retail) on the basis of providing coverage in relation to personal life and health and offering insurance services to strengthen the financial resilience of individuals. As regards our asset management, positive impacts are created by fostering access to services for customers to reach their financial goals. As insurance and asset management activities are data-driven, securing data privacy and confidentiality is key for us. By prioritizing the protection of data, we deem our information-related impacts on customers to be positive.

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long- term)

Impacts on customers may translate into risks for Allianz. These are primarily reputational and policy risks as well as risks related to changes in customer behavior. Reputational damage may occur if products are perceived as discriminatory or non-inclusive, or if pricing or coverage inadvertently disadvantages certain groups. Furthermore, trust in insurance products can be undermined by unclear communication or information being hard to access, leading to misunderstandings about policy details and hence unsubstantiated expectations about coverage. Reputational risks may also follow from the introduction of new sustainability regulations, such as new customer protection requirements, leading to a more complex business environment in which the failure to transparently integrate ESG criteria into the design, marketing, and distribution of insurance products could expose a company to accusations of greenwashing. An inadequate advisory process that does not meet regulatory standards can lead to increased costs for Allianz, an inability to provide adequate product information, and increased customer dissatisfaction. Policy risks associated with the dynamic nature of insurance distribution and disclosure requirements can exacerbate this risk. Customer behavior-related risks may arise from insurers’ increasing use of behavior modification techniques and their perceived intrusion into the personal lives of consumers. For example, strategies that aim to promote healthier or safer behaviors among policyholders that reduce their risk exposure could be seen as intrusive or as violating personal privacy, potentially leading to customer resentment. The loss of sensitive customer data due to data privacy breaches could cause financial loss for Allianz in the form of legal and regulatory penalties, fines, and lawsuits from affected customers and could severely damage the Allianz brand.

Risks

Our focus on customer experience alongside the customer journey does not just provide positive impacts of our insurance activities (Life/Health and Property-Casualty retail) for consumers and end-users but is also associated with material opportunities through increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, as expressed via the Net Promoter Score (NPS) (entity-specific sustainability matter). Such opportunities may materialize through gaining and retaining customers by contributing to offering insurance services that strengthen financial resilience and support retail customers' financial goals.

We are dedicated to building trust and delivering value to our retail customers, which is a core element of our strategy. Our policies are designed to foster customer satisfaction, ensure transparency and prioritize data privacy compliance in our operations. We have set high targets and ambitions focused on customer loyalty and satisfaction to ensure a customer-centric approach throughout the organization. Key actions include gathering customer feedback, implementing robust data privacy measures, and providing access to quality information about our products and services.

Strategy and business model related to consumers and end-users Insurance is inherently a social business, and since our founding in 1890, customers have been at our core. Our corporate purpose, “We secure your future”, reflects our commitment to strengthen society and instill confidence through the quality of our products and services. We constantly innovate to meet our customers' changing needs, ensuring their protection and creating lasting value for them. Allianz Group serves around 128 million customers 1 in almost 70 countries, including 112 million retail customers. For S4 consumers and end-users reporting we focus on private individuals, excluding corporate or commercial customers. In line with our long-standing target-setting and reporting, we are using the term “customers” instead of “consumers”. Retail customers we can materially impact include policyholders, account/deposit owners, asset management clients, and service users of Allianz Group. End-users we impact are individuals who benefit from our products or services but who are not direct retail customers, such as insurance claim beneficiaries or additional insured persons.

As a financial services provider, we positively impact our retail customers and end-users insurance and asset through our management business. Our insurance products directly contribute to the material sustainability matter “personal safety.”

into risks and opportunities for Allianz. The risks are primarily reputational and policy risks, as well as risks related to changes in customer behavior. Allianz recognizes these risks and has implemented mitigation actions and processes to address them. They can be found in section Processes and actions related to customers and end-users.

Opportunities may arise through increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty also expressed for our insurance retail customers via the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and can materialize through gaining and retaining customers by contributing to offering insurance services that strengthen financial resilience and support retail customers' financial goals.

The Allianz Customer Model (ACM) is our end-to-end global business model for our insurance subsidiaries which puts the customer at the center of everything we do and enables Allianz to be simple, digital, and scalable. Our ambition is to simplify and harmonize our business globally, transforming the insurance value chain across products, sales, claims, and operations. The ACM was first designed for Retail Property and Casualty lines, then extended to Health, Life, B2B2C, Medium and Large Corporate insurance, and Reinsurance. We are continuously rolling out the model across Allianz insurance subsidiaries. Business Transformation is the transformation and innovation engine of the Allianz Group and follows the ambition to capture the unexploited opportunities of digitally mature customers by adjusting the current business models and scaling best-in-class practices globally.

To ensure our insurance solutions, products, and services are relevant and valuable to our customers, we systematically analyze retail customer pain points and improve Customer Journeys. We use insights from “Voice of the Customer” (VoC) and NPS surveys to improve insurance products, services, communications, and processes. We combine and analyze sources of retail customer data in strict accordance with applicable privacy laws to prioritize and implement structural improvements. Learnings from VoC and NPS programs help design the Allianz experience globally. Local subsidiaries bring this vision to life and use retail customer feedback to derive concrete actions, e.g., proactively informing retail customers about the status of their claims. For details on engagement processes, please refer to section Engaging with customers and end-users.

As insurance is a data-based business, data protection and privacy are of the utmost importance for us and our relationship with our retail customers. Allianz is deeply committed to handling personal data responsibly and transparently. This includes using personal data only for specified and legitimate purposes, keeping it secure, and communicating openly about its use. Additionally, Allianz integrates data protection into product design and collaborates with industry associations, members of parliament, and authorities to contribute to the updating and modernization of privacy legislation. We recognize data protection and privacy as a material topic and our commitment to it is rooted in the recognition that personal data belongs to the individual customer and end-user, whose trust is the foundation of our business. For further details on our data privacy efforts, please refer to the sections Engaging with customers and end-users and Actions.

Policies related to customers and end- users Policies are instrumental in implementing our strategy and business model, as they constitute the framework of the management principles that we apply to our decision-making. The Allianz Standard for Customer Protection promotes and protects customer interests. It defines requirements to ensure Allianz subsidiaries design, distribute, and service products to meet legal requirements and customer expectations. This aligns with Allianz’s strategic objective to be truly customer-centric. The Standard applies throughout the product lifecycle, from pre-contractual negotiations to fulfilling contractual obligations.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Engaging with customers and end- users Allianz subsidiaries must operate on the trust of stakeholders – customers, employees, and the general public – based on performance and integrity. All subsidiaries are required to adhere to the following customer protection principles throughout the retail product lifecycle, as outlined in the Allianz Customer Protection Standard, from high-level strategic planning to individual customer engagement:

The Standard is applicable to all subsidiaries based on the principle of proportionality, which is applicable to the methods and extent of implementation, but it does not influence the initial decision of whether or not to undertake the implementation itself. Group Compliance owns the Allianz Standard for Customer Protection, approved by the Allianz SE Board member in charge of Group Compliance. The Allianz SE Board of Management will be informed of all material changes. This policy covers the material sustainability matters (quality) information and “Social inclusion” via non-discrimination, access to products and services, and responsible marketing practices.

To support the delivery on principles laid out in the Allianz Customer Protection Standard, Allianz uses the globally recognized NPS to measure customer loyalty for our retail insurance business through customers’ willingness to recommend Allianz. In 2022, Allianz switched to a digital NPS (dNPS) paradigm for continuous measurement of retail customer loyalty, eliminating seasonality and deepening understanding of retail customer sentiment. The digital measurement sets higher standards for our insurance subsidiaries as they are measured against a broader set of competitors. As of October 2024, subsidiaries can run a mix-mode NPS study combining digital and phone surveys which allows for an even broader opportunity to survey and help understand our retail customers’ needs. A third-party global provider runs the retail NPS survey using a double-blind approach, ensuring respondents are unaware it is from Allianz. It asks policyholders and co-decision makers how likely they are to recommend their insurer on a scale from 0 to 10. The NPS score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors (0–6 ratings) from Promoters (9–10 ratings). Allianz’s market position is determined by comparing its NPS score to the market average. NPS market position calculations are detailed in the Allianz Customer Experience Functional Rule. Systematic analytics generate insights which support improvements in business segments not yet leading their market in customer recommendations/loyalty. NPS targets are set in the Allianz planning cycle and linked to top management remuneration (see the section Targets related to customers and end-users).

The Allianz Customer Experience Functional Rule provides the framework for the implementation of the retail top-down digital NPS and VoC programs across the retail insurance business of the Allianz Group. For details, please refer to the section Engaging with customers and end-users. This Functional Rule encompasses standards on collecting and analyzing retail customer feedback on satisfaction, recommendation, and loyalty, which serve as an indicator for service quality within the company (VoC) and are compared to competitors (NPS). Insights from this measurement program enable its products, services, communications, and Allianz to processes to meet retail customer needs and expectations. The accountability for the implementation of the Customer Experience Functional Rule lies with the Head of Customer Experience in Group Strategy, Marketing and Distribution (GSMD). The Functional Rule is characterized by specific standards, calculations, and rules, which are binding. The documentation is accessible to all relevant parties at all times. The Allianz Customer Experience Functional Rule addresses the material sustainability matters of “Information-related impacts” and “Social inclusion”.

− Center the business around customer needs, embedding this approach throughout the subsidiary's culture and operations. − Cultivate a culture encouraging employees and distributors to act

in good faith at each customer touchpoint.

− Ensure that the board or equivalent governing body is fully this Standard, its principles and holding senior management for enforcing adherence to

− Deliver clear, accurate information to help customers make informed, timely decisions and take responsibility for their actions. − Consistently provide high-quality services, responsiveness, and

relevant advice.

− Ensure fair and transparent outcomes, avoiding disadvantages due to customer biases, lack of knowledge, or vulnerability.

NPS effectiveness is evaluated during the annual external audit and assessed in regular strategic and planning dialogues between Allianz SE and the respective insurance subsidiaries.

− Treat customers respectfully, providing support to help them understand product benefits without unreasonable barriers. − Regularly assess if current products meet customers’ needs. − Systematically monitor and review processes to manage non-

The VoC program distributes brief satisfaction surveys to retail customers who recently interacted with Allianz along five key customer journeys at pre-defined steps. Customers rate their satisfaction with the service. Subsidiaries must mitigate low ratings (1–3 stars) by contacting the customer and use insights for service improvements. All insurance subsidiaries with retail customer contact fall within the VoC program scope.

The APS, the highest policy document of the Allianz Privacy Framework, internal standard that establishes the data protection and privacy requirements for the proper handling of customers´ and end-users´ personal data, and therefore, addresses the material sustainability matter “Information-related impact.”

Responsibility for NPS and VoC lies with the Head of Customer Experience in Group Strategy, Marketing and Distribution. At the subsidiary lies with the Head of Market Management. NPS and VoC are linked to the Allianz Customer Experience Functional Rule.

All policies mentioned above are published in the Allianz Corporate Rules Book. For further details, please refer to the sections Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies and Allianz ESRS Policies.

These principles sustain customer trust, bolster stakeholder confidence, uphold public respect, and contribute to offering insurance services that strengthen financial resilience and support customers' financial goals.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

The foundation of the APS is to be transparent about how we use personal data and to ensure we protect it. We strive to communicate openly about our personal data processing by publishing privacy notices on our websites and when we collect personal data to explain who we are; how we collect, share, and use data; and how individuals can exercise their privacy rights. Our subsidiaries are also required to implement and maintain effective processes to address data protection and privacy-related requests, complaints, and incidents.

Our Group-wide privacy framework continues to mature as we aim to provide services through a digital-by-default approach. The program includes embedding robust privacy controls and creating a privacy-focused culture through Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), data ethics assessments, and monitoring. Our privacy risk management process identifies and manages privacy risks at the operational level to ensure they are measured, monitored, and mitigated. PIAs of processes using personal data, like customer health data, enable early identification and management of privacy risks. We also conduct case-by-case Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) for data transfers from the EEA to third-country suppliers to ensure adequate level data privacy is maintained. We designed a TIA template in our privacy management platform and rolled it out to all EEA subsidiaries to ensure consistent, semi-automated assessments.

Targets related to customers and end- users Allianz Group sets retail NPS (customer loyalty) targets in its three-year planning cycle, measured by the percentage of Loyalty Leading business segments (Property-Casualty and Life/Health). Loyalty Leadership is a category within NPS describing the performance of Allianz against the rest of the market at a local level. It is the best of four categories in the rating system (Below Market/At Market/Above Market/Loyalty Leader). In 2021, we aimed for 50 % of retail segments to be Loyalty Leaders by 2024. We exceeded this target in 2024, with 57 % of the measured insurance segments achieving Loyalty Leader status. NPS is one of the sustainability-related targets that influences the remuneration of the Allianz SE Board of Management as well as that of the top managers of our local subsidiaries (please refer to the section Board of Management target process).

141 S4 Consumers and End-users

loyalty via NPS, customer satisfaction is measured via VoC for our retail insurance subsidiaries. While VoC performance and scores are not tied to top management remuneration, Allianz has high VoC ambitions. They are set on a global level on overall customer satisfaction rating (using a 5-point scale), percentage of customers offered the opportunity to provide feedback (customer reach), and percentage of issues resolved within 48 hours from the customers with the satisfaction rating of 3 stars or fewer. These ambitions are reviewed annually with insurance subsidiaries and revised as needed. NPS targets and VoC ambitions are connected to the Allianz Customer Experience Functional Rule.

The targets outlined in this section are based on our strategic priorities and set for specific material sustainability matters. For further material sustainability matters without explicit target, we focus our efforts on the established policy framework. Policy and action effectiveness is tracked via the corporate rule book process. For details, see the sections Policies related to customers and end-users and Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies.

Processes and actions related to customers and end-users

Processes and channels to raise concerns

Under the Allianz Standard for Customer Protection, subsidiaries must provide continuous support throughout the retail product lifecycle. This support includes managing sold products and services and assisting customers, especially with service requests, claims, or complaints.

An effective external complaint management process builds trust, maintains customer relationships, ensures long-term retention, and safeguards Allianz’s reputation. Subsidiaries must comply with laws, regulations, and corporate rules concerning complaints management. Each subsidiary must have a standardized process to handle complaints and ensure fair treatment of customers.

Additionally, Allianz has engagement channels, such as SpeakUp@Allianz, that are open to all people, inside and outside Allianz, who feel that they have been impacted by Allianz’s business or by a business in the Allianz value chain. For more details, please refer to the section Corruption and bribery.

Additionally, retail customers have the opportunity to engage with Allianz via the Voice of the Customer program. By asking the customers for their satisfaction rating along five key Customer Journeys, they have the opportunity to provide any (negative) feedback. In this way, VoC identifies dissatisfied retail customers (3 stars or fewer). As stated in the Customer Experience Functional Rule, subsidiaries have to contact these customers within 48 hours and address their issues, creating a proactive opportunity for retail customers to get support in resolving their concerns.

Actions

We implement specific actions to act on material impacts, mitigate material risks, and pursue material opportunities. Allianz conducts the Retail Products Review annually and on an ad hoc basis in all subsidiaries with retail insurance business to assess whether Allianz’s insurance products offer fair value to our customers. It retail complements the product oversight and governance processes adopted at the subsidiary level. These exercises aim to ensure effective management of customer protection risks prior to the launch of the products and on an ongoing basis. Appropriate actions will be implemented to mitigate potential risks (if any) to the customers.

New training for agents has been developed covering Allianz’s sustainability strategy, product sustainability elements, and “Dos and Don’ts” for customer advice. The goal is to authentically communicate sustainability initiatives, fostering trust and transparency, avoiding greenwashing, and thereby positively impacting customer loyalty. The e-learning is included in the 15 hours of mandatory training for insurance agents under the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) regulation, expected for completion by 2024. It has been rolled out in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Austria, Türkiye, Switzerland, and Central and Eastern Europe. Completion is monitored by a dedicated Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution team.

The global Financial Literacy Hub was established in summer 2023 and, since then, has been available to customers around the globe, including initiatives such as the Finance Workout, or the Allianz Ready Coach program, which have been designed to help customers and members of the general public build financial knowledge through educational content.

Sustainability matters

G1 Business conduct

– Adverse impact + Positive impact

Material and strategic focus

Material

Not material

Adverse impacts may arise from our proprietary investment portfolio, given our international and cross-sectoral portfolio, which includes exposures to sectors or governments with a higher likelihood of business conduct-related issues.

Impacts (relevant in the short-, medium-, and long- term)

Given our practices related to corporate culture health, whistleblower protection, supplier management, and corruption and bribery prevention, we deem our impacts on business conduct in our own operations to be positive. In addition, we engage with political stakeholders with regards to sustainability-related aspects, and we actively engage in and support regulatory developments.

By virtue of association, Allianz may suffer reputational damage if third parties such as investees, suppliers, or customers engage in or otherwise experience significant business conduct issues, such as critical cases of fraud, corruption, bribery, abuse of suppliers, failure to protect whistleblowers, or inappropriate political lobbying/influencing, whether actual or perceived. Insofar as these are key business partners for Allianz and the business conduct issues attract public exposure (e.g., through social media, traditional media, NGOs, or regulators), Allianz may be viewed as enabling or complicit in the business conduct issues – or put under pressure to publicly take a moral or ethical stance for or against the business partner. Such developments have the potential to cause collateral damage to Allianz’s own reputation. With respect to our own conduct, we face reputational risks in the event that lobbying is perceived to primarily advance or protect the interests of Allianz at the detriment of other stakeholders; is insufficiently transparent or otherwise not compliant with associated transparency laws; or inconsistent with external or internal statements regarding company positions.

Risks

Opportunities are associated with enhancing our corporate culture, with the aim of increasing risk awareness among our employees and avoiding misconduct. In addition, engaging on sustainability- related matters with political stakeholders – such as the net-zero transition or via our contributions to (E.U.) standard-setting activities – is an opportunity for us to credibly convey our sustainability ambition and strategy.

Opportunities




This section details our commitment to maintaining high ethical standards and integrity in all of our business operations. Our policy emphasizes promoting transparency, preventing corruption and bribery, as well as having a resilient supplier management – all underpinned by our compliance with laws and regulations. The strategy involves setting guidelines for ethical behavior and fostering a culture of accountability. Key actions include implementing supplier due diligence, compliance training, and establishing clear reporting mechanisms for unethical conduct. This section further provides transparent information about our political influence and main lobbying activities.

The following section on ESRS G1 focuses on Allianz own operations, as required by the ESRS provisions. Our CSRD DMA has additionally identified that the sustainability matter business conduct is material for the proprietary investment portfolio of our value chain. Specifically, potential adverse impacts may arise from our proprietary investment portfolio, given exposures to sectors or governments with a higher likeli- hood of business conduct–related issues. Allianz evaluates these potential impacts in our proprietary investment portfolio as part of the internal AIS process for listed assets, the referral process of ASIS for non-listed assets, and the Group Restrictions. For more information on the AIS, please see section Adverse Impact Steering (AIS) for listed assets.

The Allianz FRSI describes all relevant rules, principles, and sustainability integration processes for the proprietary investment portfolio of the Allianz Group. For further information about this overarching policy, please refer to the section Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies. Allianz has not adopted specific targets for business conduct, because robust compliance policies, processes, and mandatory trainings ensure employees understand business conduct expectations and core values.

Corporate culture and business conduct

Corporate culture and business conduct policies

Allianz is aware of the high importance of a corporate governance and business conduct structure to ensure compliance with legal requirements as well as a profound basis for sustainable economic success. We are committed to supporting transparency by outlining our corporate governance principles, e.g., business conduct, business ethics, and corporate culture, including anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and the protection of whistleblowers. Moreover, we report on our management with suppliers and our activities related to political contributions and lobbying.

We have adopted several policies in the meaning of ESRS and in relation to our business conduct.

The Allianz Group Code of Conduct reflects our values and principles and thus guides our employees in their actions and decisions. How we act, how we operate, and the decisions that we make are focused on caring for each other and treating everyone fairly and with respect. The Allianz Group Code of Conduct outlines the importance of acting with integrity and transparency, commits to the prevention of financial crime, and also encourages Allianz employees to have our business partners commit to abide by our Allianz Group Code of Conduct. For further information on the Allianz Group Code of Conduct, please refer to the sections Allianz ESRS policies and Corruption and bribery. According to our mentioned practices related to corporate culture health, whistleblower protection, supplier management, and prevention of corruption and bribery, we deem our impacts on business conduct to be positive. For further information about supplier management, refer to the section Management of relationships with suppliers and, for prevention of corruption and bribery, refer to the section Corruption and bribery. The effectiveness of our policies is tracked via the Corporate Rules Book process. For further details please refer to the section Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies.

We engage with political stakeholders in relation to sustainability matters and actively engage in and support regulatory developments. Please see section Political influence and lobbying activities for further details.

For more information about our impacts, risks and opportunities in the supply and value chain, please refer to section S2 Workers in the value chain.

144 G1 Business Conduct

The identified impacts have the potential to translate into risks for Allianz. These risks are reputational. Allianz recognizes these risks and has implemented various mitigation actions and initiatives to address them. An overview can be found in the following sections.

The outlined policies and practices in place help us to mitigate possible negative impacts, identified risks, and, in addition, the actions taken can be associated with opportunities to enhance our corporate culture, with the aim of increasing risk awareness among our employees and avoiding misbehavior. Furthermore, our political contributions and lobbying activities credibly convey our sustainability ambition and strategy.

Management of relationships with suppliers This section describes the Allianz Group’s activities in the field of supplier management. The Group policy covering the sustainability matter of supplier management is the Allianz Group Standard for Procurement.

The Group and local Procurement functions tender and source services and products for the Allianz Group by partnering with thousands of vendors all around the world for commodities such as IT, professional services, and marketing. Our Allianz Group Standard for Procurement (AGSP) and associated processes are reviewed regularly, and local procurement functions are asked to locally implement the standard. In the course of the onboarding process, as described in the AGSP, suppliers registered in our standard tool for procurement are asked to comply with the VCoC, or to have a comparable code of conduct in place.

We at Allianz aim to do business with responsible suppliers who understand the nature of the products, materials, and services they are supplying, and who recognize their responsibility to protect the environment and foster good relations with their employees and local communities. These expectations are embedded in our VCoC and Allianz Sustainable Procurement Charter.

Please note additional information especially on human rights related topics in our supply chain in the section S2 Workers in the value chain.

Corruption and bribery

This section describes the impact of ethics, responsible business, and compliance matters on the Allianz Group’s activities. Further, it describes the impact of the Allianz Group’s activities and relationships on compliance. The concepts and achievements related to the manage- ment of these impacts are described with a focus on the compliance management system, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering. Additionally, subsidiaries maintain their own programs.

The Allianz Group Compliance Policy, Allianz Standard for Anti- Financial Crime Compliance, Allianz Functional Rule for Anti- Financial Crime Compliance, Allianz Compliance Manual, and the Allianz Group Code of Conduct are policies which address the topics of corporate culture, whistleblower protection, and corruption and bribery on Group level.

The Allianz Group Compliance Policy establishes the core principles and tasks of a Compliance Function within Allianz Group. It ensures that the organization and work of Allianz Group`s Compliance functions worldwide adhere to a consistent set of minimum rules. It defines also that the Compliance Function develops, implements and oversees the compliance framework for the assigned compliance risk areas such as anti-bribery and corruption.

The Allianz Group Standard for Anti-financial Crime Compliance defines Allianz Group’s framework for the management of financial crime risk. As supplemented by the Allianz Functional Rule for Anti- Financial Crime Compliance, this Standard establishes core principles for compliance with rules and regulatory standards in the major areas for combating financial crime, including for anti-fraud, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML), economic sanctions compliance, prevention of tax evasion, and protection against employee misconduct.

The Allianz Functional Rule for Anti-Financial Crime Compliance supports the Allianz Standard for Anti-Financial Crime Compliance by further specifying the requirements in the Standard, including by providing guidance for understanding how the Standard should be implemented in practice.

The Allianz Compliance Manual (“Manual”) provides guidance on the execution of the principles and tasks of the local Compliance functions and departments. The aim of the Manual is to enhance organizational processes and operations through standardization and to ensure consistency in the implementation and operation of the includes, among others, the anti-retaliation requirements.

The Allianz Group Code of Conduct outlines the basic principles and values that guide the everyday decisions and conduct of all employees. The current version of the Allianz Group Code of Conduct was approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management in 2020. The key principles addressed by the Allianz Group Code of Conduct and the accompanying training are mutual respect, integrity, transparency, and responsibility. For further information on the Allianz Group Code of Conduct, please refer to the section Allianz ESRS policies.

Prevention and detection of corruption or bribery

Allianz has zero tolerance for fraud. We are committed to complying with all applicable anti-fraud, anti-bribery, and anti-corruption laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate.

Zero tolerance applies irrespective of who benefits from the fraud – Allianz as a company, other Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matter – internal parties (employees, tied agents, intermediaries), or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz.

New joiners at Allianz are informed of their obligation to adhere to the Allianz Group Code of Conduct. The Allianz Group Code of Conduct is also available on the Allianz website. In addition to the Allianz Group Code of Conduct, Allianz fosters a culture of anti- financial crime awareness. Subsidiaries are required to communicate and disseminate relevant details of the anti-financial crime policies relevant and procedures intermediaries. Information is communicated in a way to ensure that parties working for or on behalf of a subsidiary understand the importance and aim of the anti-financial crime program and the nature of the financial crime risk that the subsidiary must manage.

To protect against fraud, we will take prompt and appropriate action where necessary – against employees, others acting on behalf of Allianz, or third parties.

The following tables show the training coverage of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering training: It is calculated by the division of training sessions completed and functions-at-risk or Allianz SE Board members enrolled for the training. Enrolment in the training is dependent on the frequency of the training requirement. The Anti-corruption training must be completed at least every three years. Therefore, only these persons who are required to complete the training in the reporting period are considered as enrolled 1.

Similarly, Allianz does not tolerate bribery and corruption. Employees are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly offering, requesting, accepting, providing, paying for, soliciting, promising, authorizing, or receiving anything of value (anything monetary or non- monetary that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any public official or anyone in the private sector in order to obtain or retain business or gain an improper personal or business advantage. We follow international standards and applicable laws in relation to corruption and bribery, money laundering, and other relevant compliance risk areas. We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws, as well as of breaches of Allianz-specific rules. For information on Human Rights related incidents, please refer to the section Human rights in own workforce.

Allianz trains its employees, board members, and other persons working in functions-at-risk with regard to financial crime topics. The definition of functions-at-risk is based on the Allianz Functional Rule for Anti-Financial Crime.

For information provided to suppliers, please refer to the section Management of relationships with suppliers above.

Anti-corruption training must be provided at least every three years to all employees. The sole possible limit in relation to the obligation to provide such training applies in relation to employees who perform activities entirely unconnected to the tasks or services typical of the subsidiary’s business. All other employees must complete at least a basic training.

Political influence and lobbying activities

Political influence & lobbying activities

This section describes the Allianz Group’s activities in the field of political influence and lobbying.

As a financial services company, we operate in a highly regulated environment. It is crucial that we stay up to date with changes in the regulatory and political landscape, and help shape effective regulation by contributing our knowledge and expertise. Engaging with political stakeholders on, for example, sustainability matters such as the net-zero transition and E.U. standard-setting activities allows us to credibly convey our ambitions and strategies. At the same time, we are aware of potential reputational risks deriving from lobbying activities that fall short of transparency standards or contradict our public or internal statements.

Our Group Regulatory and Political Affairs (GRPA) department is the center of competence and central coordinator for regulatory and political management activities across the Allianz Group (”Group”). GRPA is based at Allianz’s headquarters in Munich, with representative offices in Berlin and Brussels. Its purpose is to enable Allianz to navigate the Group’s regulatory and political environment. GRPA actively monitors changes in the regulatory and political environment and advises management to ensure that the impacts of these changes are accounted for in the Group’s strategy and business activities.

In addition, GRPA actively contributes to policy processes of strategic relevance to the Group at national, European, and international levels and based on the Group’s profound business knowledge and expertise (“lobbying”). In doing so, GRPA considers the interests of citizens, businesses, and society at large in a world of increasing uncertainty.

1_The majority of political contributions, around 80 %, originates from Europe, while the rest is from Asia Pacific and the Americas. Additionally, about two-thirds of the political contributions are financial, with the remaining one-third being in-kind contributions.

According to our Group policy, in-kind contributions are measured based on market values whenever possible, mainly for real estate (e.g., providing office space) or donation of equipment. Further, Allianz SE board members’ in-kind contributions are measured based on business hours spent. To calculate the monetary value of the business hours spent, we use the following formula, according to the calculation method for the German Lobby Register: Share of hours spent by

147 G1 Business Conduct

Allianz SE Board members in their total working hours* (base salary + annual bonus).

Main lobbying activities Our lobbying activities in 2024 included the following main topics:

Solvency II is the prudential regime for insurance undertakings in the E.U.. With regard to the recently adopted amendments to the Solvency II Directive (“Solvency II review”), Allianz generally shares the positions of the German Insurance Association (GDV) and Insurance Europe. Particularly, the accurate calibration of risk parameters is of importance. The

Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive (IRRD) introduces the obligation to draw up recovery and resolution plans for the insurance sector. With regard to the structure of the plans, Allianz generally shares the positions of the GDV and Insurance Europe. From Allianz’s point of view, legal certainty regarding the requirements for the preparation of (Group) recovery plans and a practical design for the intervention rights of the resolution authorities are of particular importance.

Allianz is impacted by sustainability reporting in its dual role as a provider and user of sustainability information. In this context, Allianz calls for the streamlining of reporting obligations and the need for interoperability between global and European standards. Concerning disclosures in the context of the further development of the E.U. Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), Allianz considers that the introduction of a categorization system could be a useful approach to improve product understanding and the advisory process.

Confronted with massive financing needs, e.g., for the green and digital transitions, E.U. policymakers have recently started a new attempt to revitalize and implement the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Individual measures under discussion include the revival of the EU’s securitization market, the harmonization of E.U. supervision, and the introduction of a European savings and investment product. With regard to the content of these proposals, which are still at an early stage, Allianz generally agrees with the positions of GDV and Insurance Europe.

The aim of the E.U. Commission’s Retail Investment Strategy (RIS) is to expand the protection of retail investors in order to promote investments in E.U. capital markets. The proposal includes, among other things, amendments to the IDD and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID). We welcome the E.U. Commission’s objective of improving the participation of retail investors in financial markets and support the proposed standardized digital transmission

of information to customers as well as the strengthening of financial education. Allianz believes it is important to find a balanced approach between costs and disclosure obligations in the interests of consumers. With the proposed Framework for Financial Data Access (FiDA), the E.U. Commission aims to give private and corporate customers more control over the use of their financial data. From Allianz’s perspective, it is important that a balance is struck between costs, benefits, and risks in the interest of consumers. The broad scope of application should the ambitious implementation timetable stretched, otherwise insurance companies will be disproportionately burdened in their role as data owners and the benefits for customers will not be achieved. Sensitive business information should always remain protected.

E.U. Transparency Register Allianz SE is registered in the E.U. Transparency Register (identification number 05503341949-54).

Appointment to the Supervisory Board On 8 May 2024, the Annual General Meeting appointed Dr. Jörg Schneider as a new member to the Supervisory Board. Prior to his appointment, and still to this day, Dr. Schneider is a member of the Supervisory Body of the Bayerische Landesbank AöR. Apart from Dr. Schneider’s appointment, there have been no appointments of administrative, management, or supervisory bodies who held a comparable position in public administration (including) regulators in the two years preceding their appointment.

Information about members’ experience relevant to sectors, products, and geographic locations of undertaking Annual Report – Supervisory Board Qualification Matrix

Board of Management Pursuant to the German Act on the Supervision of Insurance Undertakings (Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz, VAG) and Circular 9/2023 (VA) by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), members of the Board of Management need to be fit and proper. Pursuant to Art. 273 of Commission Delegated Regulation (E.U.) 2015/35, insurance and reinsurance companies have to establish, implement, and maintain documented policies and adequate procedures that ensure the fitness and propriety of their members of the Board of Management at all times. Fitness in this context means that a person is capable of sound and prudent management of the company based on their professional qualifications, knowledge, and experience. This requires appropriate theoretical and practical knowledge of the insurance business and sufficient management experience. Members of the Board of Management must have sufficient knowledge in all business segments, allowing the control of all segments. However, when assessing the level of knowledge required, the duties assigned to the individual board members shall be taken into account. All members of the Board of Management need to have appropriate qualifications, experience, and knowledge in the areas of insurance markets and financial markets, the business strategy and model, the system of governance, financial and actuarial analysis, the regulatory framework, and regulatory requirements. The assessment of fitness shall take into account the insurance, financial, accounting, actuarial, and management skills of the individual member. Members of the Board of Management need to be knowledgeable in the areas of insurance-specific risk management and information technology. Allianz uses an internal model for the calculation of its solvability capital requirements. Therefore, members of the Board of Management need to have sufficient theoretical and practical knowledge of the company’s internal model. Considering Allianz’s international business model, members of the Board of Management need to be fluent in English. A person is to be considered proper if no facts are evident that establish a person’s impropriety. Impropriety is to be assumed if personal circumstances, based on general life experience, justify the assumption that these circumstances may impair the diligent and proper fulfillment of the mandate as a member of the Board of Management. At Allianz SE, the fitness and propriety of members of the Board of Management are ensured by various means: The requirements regarding fitness and propriety have to be considered by the Supervisory Board when assessing the appointment of members of the Management Board. Furthermore, the appointment of a new member to the Board of Management is subject to the approval of BaFin and therefore subject to BaFin confirming the fitness and propriety of the respective candidate. In the event of the renewal of a board member’s appointment, the propriety of that person is checked by BaFin anew. In addition, the Supervisory Board assesses the fitness and propriety of the individual members of the Board of Management on a yearly basis. A summary of the results of its annual assessment is included in the Supervisory Board’s report. Information on the relevant experience of the members of Allianz SE’s Board of Management can also be found in their respective CVs, available on the Allianz company website. Supervisory Board Pursuant to the VAG and Circular 10/2023 (VA) by BaFin, members of the Supervisory Board must also be fit and proper. As for the members of the Board of Management, the company needs to establish, implement, and maintain documented policies and adequate procedures that ensure such fitness and propriety of the members of the Supervisory Board at all times (Art. 273 of Commission Delegated Regulation (E.U.) 2015/35). Fitness means that a member of the Supervisory Board is professionally capable at all times of appropriately controlling and monitoring the members of the Board of Management and actively supporting the company’s development. To this end, the member must have sufficient theoretical and practical expertise in all business segments to understand the business activities of the company and be able to assess their risks for the company. The assessment of fitness shall take into account the insurance, financial, accounting, actuarial, and management skills of the individual member. The member must be familiar with the key legal provisions for the company. In order to be able to fulfill their supervisory function effectively, members of the Supervisory Board must have or acquire insurance-specific basic knowledge of risk management. The Supervisory Board as a whole needs to have knowledge in the fields of accounting, insurance actuarial practice, investment management, auditing, and the internal model. The same standards of propriety apply as for the Board of Management. At Allianz SE, the fitness and propriety of members of the Supervisory Board are ensured by various means: The requirements regarding fitness and propriety are reflected in the Supervisory Board’s objectives for composition of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, which are included in the Corporate Governance Statement. The fitness and propriety of the members of the Supervisory Board needs to be confirmed by BaFin. In the event of the renewal of a Supervisory Board member’s appointment, the propriety of that person is checked by BaFin anew. In addition, each of the twelve members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE must confirm on an annual basis to BaFin that the fitness requirements are met. Based on the outcome of this self-assessment, the Supervisory Board creates an Annual Development Plan, addressing needs for further training in the form of workshops, targeted seminars, and the like. The Annual Development Plan also has to be submitted to BaFin. An overview of the self-assessment regarding the individual skills relevant for a member’s fitness can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement. Additional information on the relevant experience of the members of Allianz SE’s Supervisory Board can be found in their respective CVs, available on the Allianz company website. Furthermore, the Allianz Group possesses extensive expertise across various areas of sustainability. The section Sustainability Strategy and Governance outlines how the Board of Management and Supervisory Board can harness this expertise and benefit from regular updates provided by our sustainability experts and committees.

Methodology and process to identify and assess material impacts, risks, and opportunities

different insurance lines of business, as impact drivers can differ based on the underlying insured activities and assets. In addition, for our Life/Health commercial lines, a country analysis is performed to assess impacts related to potential business conduct and human rights issues. A sustainability matter is deemed material if the combination of scale, scope, remediation possibility, and likelihood breaches a pre-defined qualitative threshold.

Impact materiality

When identifying and assessing impacts, we consider positive and adverse actual and potential impacts caused by, contributed to by, or connected with the Allianz Group, either through our own operations, or our business relationships. The materiality of such impacts is assessed based on the criteria scale, scope, remediation possibility, and likelihood. The impact materiality assessment is primarily based on desktop research and internal experts’ evaluations, with consideration of in-house and external data where available and appropriate, depending on the area of the value chain being assessed.

In the following section, we provide details on Allianz’s CSRD DMA process and methodology that is applied to identify and assess material impacts, risks, and opportunities. The description also covers specifications regarding dependencies on ecosystem services.

Mainly quantitative assessment For our Property-Casualty commercial lines, proprietary investments, and third-party investments, the CSRD DMA is data-driven to identify (actual/potential) impacts related to the Allianz Group portfolios, leveraging internal and external data sources at a country, sector, and investment level. External data sources include sector proxies for environmental the Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks, and Exposure (ENCORE) database 1 as well as, for proprietary and our third-party investments, for example, principal

For proprietary investments, the CSRD DMA focuses on General Account investments. Unit-linked investments of Allianz subsidiaries are covered insofar as those investments managed by AllianzGI and PIMCO are incorporated into the assessment of our third-party investments.

Mainly qualitative assessment For our own operations, supply chain, Life/Health, and Property- Casualty retail business, we use desktop research as well as in-house and external data, where available (e.g., GHG emissions), tailored to the Allianz business context and complemented by business expert identification and assessment across evaluations.

adverse impacts on sustainability factors as per the SFDR PAIs – such as GHG emissions of investees – or ESG sub-scores by MSCI. Internal data sources pertain to Allianz-specific portfolio information, such as asset classes, country of issuer/risk exposure, and country ratings for potential human rights-related impacts. For some sustainability matters within the Pollution (ESRS E2) and Biodiversity and ecosystems (ESRS E4) topics, where data is less available, we use desktop research to populate our data-driven model at a sector level. Sources include sector proxies for pollution- and biodiversity-related impacts and dependencies from the ENCORE database. We also conduct a country analysis to assess impacts related to potential business conduct and human rights issues, similar to the analysis for our Life/Health commercial lines.

The evaluations of these criteria were enhanced by consulting a broad range of relevant business experts to ensure that Allianz portfolio-specific information was considered, especially where there was a lack of (sufficiently granular) data. Allianz will continue to work on data coverage and quality over the coming years. When assessing impact materiality at portfolio level, we apply absolute thresholds based on gross written premiums for our commercial (re)insurance business and assets under management for proprietary and third- party investments. The absolute thresholds are applied as follows: First, the respective portfolio is assessed based on the data-driven methodology described above for each sustainability matter. The assessment yields a distribution of gross written premiums and total assets under management across five different impact categories, ranging from very low to very high, representative of the severity of indirect impacts the portfolio is directly linked to for each sustainability matter. Then, absolute thresholds are set based on the distribution across impact categories. As a concrete example, if the distribution for our proprietary investment portfolio indicates that more than 5 % of total assets under management – expressed as absolute thresholds – are in the very high impact category, the respective sustainability matter is classified as material. Similar thresholds are applied for the distribution across the medium and high impact categories. This ensures that both multiple smaller impacts and fewer larger impacts are considered in the assessment.

Dependencies on ecosystem services To facilitate the identification of risk drivers and their assessment, Allianz also conducts a data-driven identification and assessment of potential dependencies on ecosystem services for our Property- Casualty commercial lines and proprietary investments, based on the judgement of business experts and the ENCORE dependencies database. For the classification of ecosystem services, Allianz uses the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES).

Financial materiality — Risk perspective

Risks from sustainability matters are identified and their financial materiality is assessed as part of the ESG risk inventory. The ESG risk inventory captures the many ways in which Allianz’s business can be negatively impacted across all value chain dimensions by sustainability matters over the short, medium, and long term. In this context, the definition of short, medium and long term time horizons follows ESRS 1, as described in the section Process to identify and assess material impacts, risks, and opportunities. The time horizons defined in this way consider the different contract durations in the insurance business (e.g., one year for typical Property-Casualty products, more than 20 years for certain life insurance products) and the corresponding different holding periods of the related investments. They also reflect time horizons of key internal processes, such as the short term one-year reporting cycle, the medium term three-year time horizon for strategic planning and capital allocation, and the long- term horizon of transformative strategies such as the decarbonization strategy. The ESG risk inventory is based on a qualitative approach uniformly applied to all dimensions and sub-dimensions of the value chain and all sustainability matters specified by the ESRS. Allianz’s locations and business activities are generally considered in aggregate for this assessment rather than at a location-specific level. The ESG risk inventory involves a scoping process to identify the value chain sub-dimensions in Life/Health and Property-Casualty, proprietary investments, asset management, and own operations relevant to the risk materiality assessment. The scoping process uses quantitative criteria and/or expert judgment depending on the nature of the value chain sub-dimension under consideration.

For each in-scope value chain sub-dimension and sustainability matter, we identify plausible risk drivers through desktop research and interviews with internal and external subject matter experts. In this context, a risk driver is any development or event wholly or primarily attributable to a sustainability matter that potentially impacts Allianz’s risk profile. The identification of risk drivers considers dependencies on and negative impacts of Allianz’s business processes on environmental and social matters, where relevant. It also considers dependencies and negative impacts of Allianz’s business partners’ business processes, which may translate into risks for Allianz.

Risk drivers are categorized as physical and transition risk drivers, depending on whether they arise from direct physical consequences of sustainability matters or from societal responses to sustainability matters. For physical risks, we distinguish between acute risks (associated with physical events) and chronic risks (associated with permanent physical displacements). For transition risks, we distinguish legal, behavioral, and between regulatory, reputational risks. One of two basic underlying scenarios is furthermore assigned to each driver. The first “strong response” scenario is characterized by a strong regulatory, legal, technological, or behavioral response to a sustainability matter, whereas the second “no response” scenario assumes the absence of such strong and timely response measures. The assignment of scenarios aligns the assessment of the risk driver with the situation that leads to the most negative risk impact for Allianz. We applied this approach to ensure a highly sensitive process in identifying potentially material risk drivers. For each identified risk driver, narratives of plausible future developments of the risk driver are used to provide insight into potential negative financial or reputational impacts for Allianz. These narratives form the basis for the qualitative assessment of the materiality of the risk drivers based on time horizon, magnitude, and likelihood. It should be noted that narratives are neither predictions nor forecasts.

Identifying and assessing climate-related risks The identification and assessment of risks for the ESG risk inventory use the same qualitative approach described above for all sustainability matters. This means that climate-relevant events are identified over the same short, medium and long term time horizons and assessed using the same methodology, taking into consideration the likelihood, magnitude, and duration of the events. The following additions apply to “Climate change” (ESRS E1).

Qualitative assessment of materiality is carried out using the earliest time horizon at which a severe but plausible adverse financial or reputational impact could occur for the assigned scenario. This time horizon is determined in the first step of the assessment. Qualitative rating scales are used to assess the magnitude of the financial or reputational impact for all value chain dimensions. The identification of actual and potential environmental risks and the assessment of financial materiality in the ESG risk inventory consider our locations and business activities collectively rather than individually. This is particularly important in the context of “Biodiversity and ecosystems” (ESRS E4), where the high level of aggregation means that we assess biodiversity and ecosystem risks at a systemic rather than an idiosyncratic level. At this level, relevant causes of physical or transition risks are those that affect entire regions, sectors, or portfolios. Finally, we assess the likelihood of the risk driver occurring and triggering a loss event within the selected time horizon using a qualitative rating scale.

in scope for the assessment. The main focus is to provide the best estimate for own funds 2 impacts.

Scenarios Allianz’s business areas are exposed to climate change in different ways depending on their characteristics, e.g., different levels of exposure to physical or transition risks in different time periods. The scenarios used for the stress test therefore cover a broad spectrum of possible climatic and economic developments. This spectrum includes low-emission pathways, limiting global warming to 1.5 °C by the end of the century, and high-emission pathways, where average global warming rises up to 4 °C. Short, medium, and long term time horizons up to 2050 are considered, which are equally relevant for the processes in the individual business areas of Allianz, the implementation of important political and economic strategies in connection with the Paris Climate Agreement, and the onset of increasing global warming and its negative consequences.

For climate change, the ESG risk inventory identifies risk drivers for common acute and chronic climate-related hazards to assess physical risks. This is consistent with the aggregation level of the value chain sub-dimensions in the ESG risk inventory. The qualitative assessment assumes assessors consider combinations of temperature-, wind-, water-, or solid mass-related hazards most relevant to the business context. Risk drivers for acute and chronic climate-related hazards are in the “no response” scenario, corresponding to high assessed emissions. For transition risks, the identification of risk drivers for transition events legal, behavioral, and reputational risks following the general approach also includes risk drivers for transition events related to public policy goals like decarbonization targets. Risk drivers for climate transition events are assessed in the “strong response scenario”, aligning with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C.

At a risk driver level, the overall risk rating is determined by applying the ratings of magnitude and likelihood to a scoring matrix. A threshold is defined on the overall rating scale above which risks are considered material. For the disclosure purposes, risks are aggregated at the level of the sustainability matters specified by the ESRS.

NGFS scenarios are selected for this analysis since they are compiled on behalf of central banks and supervisory authorities for financial stress testing, provide pathways for macroeconomic variables in a variety of scenarios representing different levels of transition and physical risk, and are available on an open-source basis. IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are the starting point for scientific studies on climate-related hazards under climate change scenarios and can be adapted for modeling underwriting risks. We considered six scenario narratives from the fourth vintage of NGFS scenarios for the integrated climate change stress test. These scenarios are essentially determined by climate policy and greenhouse gas concentrations, driving the extent of global warming. The (1) “Net-Zero 2050” scenario is determined by an orderly transition to net-zero emissions by 2050, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 °C through stringent climate policies, causing high economic strain initially.

The results of the financial materiality assessment are collected in the ESG risk inventory. The ESG risk inventory plays a crucial role in the ESG risk management process by providing a risk oversight framework for identifying, assessing, and responding to ESG risks. The ESG risk inventory is considered in the annual analysis of the Allianz Group’s most material risks, the Top Risk Assessment (TRA).

Quantitative assessment of climate change risks

Approach Complementary to the qualitative approach, we quantify the impact of climate change on Allianz’s balance sheet in a range of high- and low-emissions scenarios. In particular, we apply an integrated climate change stress test considering a limited set of risks and risk transmission channels. Results are shown in the section Climate- related risks.

The analyses in this report are subject to limitations associated with the methods and data used and the high degree of uncertainty inherent in long-term analysis. In particular, the results of the ESG risk inventory are highly dependent on the professional judgment of individual risk experts in determining Allianz-specific impacts. As professional judgment is subject to various forms of bias, the results may change in future risk assessments. In addition, new research findings may influence the conclusions.

The stress test covers both sides of the balance sheet by measuring asset- or liability-specific stress impacts, as well as their dependencies for a static balance sheet. Impacts are assessed for market and credit stresses, as well as Property-Casualty and Life/Health underwriting stresses, using NGFS/IPCC 1 scenario-based data. All entities contributing to Allianz Group’s Solvency II model are

The (2) “Below 2 °C” scenario assumes an early and orderly transition to a low-carbon economy, with a less ambitious policy target to limit global warming to below 2 °C by the end of the century, with limited impact on economic growth.

In the (3) “Delayed Transition” scenario, GHG emissions remain high until 2030, when strong policy measures limit warming to below 2 °C. Physical risks are relatively small in the “Net-Zero 2050,” “Below 2 °C,” and “Delayed Transition” scenarios over the 2050 time horizon.

The (4) “Nationally Determined Contributions” scenario includes all pledged climate policies, even if not yet implemented. However, these policies are insufficient to limit global warming to below 2 °C, leading to increasing physical risks.

Accounting only for climate policies that were in place before 2022, the (5) “Current Policies” scenario is characterized by limited transition risks and high physical risks, becoming more visible over the second half of the projection period.

In the (6) “Fragmented World” scenario, the tightening of climate policy is also delayed until after 2030, as in the “Delayed Transition” scenario. However, it is fragmented globally; countries with net-zero targets may only partially achieve them, while others maintain current policies. Overall, action is too little, too late, and global warming rises to 2.3 °C. Both physical and transition risks are high in this scenario. The “Fragmented World”, “Current Policies”, and “Nationally Determined Contributions” scenarios are projected to entail even higher physical risks after 2050, outweighing transition risks.

The climate change scenarios used for the stress test represent consistent climatic and economic scenario pathways based on a particular trajectory of GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. They are not predictions of future climatic and economic developments. The climate change scenarios are compatible with the climate-related assumptions in the annual financial statements which are often only implicitly accounted for in the valuations and/or short-term in nature to the extent that they are based on the current GHG concentrations in the atmosphere and the current economic conditions.

Methods, assumptions, and limitations NGFS scenarios are used to derive financial market variables for application in the market and credit stress modules of the integrated climate change stress test. They capture the transition risk arising from political, technological, and market events, as well as the chronic physical risk arising from the impact of temperature changes on labor productivity. Scenario variables are expanded using internal approaches to adjust regional coverage for Allianz’s main markets and consider selected sector-specific developments. Market and credit stresses are applied to market values of assets and liabilities of in-scope entities, using a simplified approach to assess mitigation of stress impacts due to policyholder profit sharing. Scenario variables in the Property-Casualty and Life/Health underwriting stress modules are derived from hazard models based on RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 of the IPCC. The Property- Casualty underwriting stress module relies on projections for Average Annual Loss for a selection of the most climate change-relevant

country and peril combinations. Property-Casualty underwriting stress variables are aggregated from location-specific data and applied at a country level. Property-Casualty underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of liabilities for NatCat risk exposures. For the Life/Health underwriting stress module, stress variables are based on projections of temperature-related excess mortality for cold and heat and their net change (i.e., combining heat and cold contributions). Country-specific Life/Health underwriting stress variables were used where available. Life/Health underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of liabilities for biometric risk exposure.

To separate the impact of climate change risk from trend growth, stress levels are assessed relative to a baseline or counterfactual scenario as defined by the NGFS, a hypothetical scenario in which neither progression of climate change nor the implementation of transition measures is assumed.

The calculation of stress impacts is based on instantaneous stresses on the static fourth quarter 2024 balance sheet, without adaptation or mitigation actions from Allianz and its business partners. Impact estimates from different stress test modules are integrated based on matching global mean temperatures for 2050 between IPCC scenarios and considering overall scenario NGFS and characteristics. No diversification between market, credit, and underwriting stresses is assumed for the aggregation.

The estimates of the effects of the integrated climate stress test are based on scientific research findings and scenario data that are currently available and considered relevant. They are subject to considerable uncertainties associated with long-term projections in general and climate change modeling in particular. These include, for the projection of hazard example, scientific uncertainties distributions and macroeconomic impacts in the climate change scenarios used. They are also subject to more fundamental uncertainties arising from the failure to take account of ecological, social, and economic cascading effects or tipping points. The integrated climate change stress test is based on central scenarios with long-term projection horizons up to 2050, which were developed specifically to analyze the medium- to long-term impact of different climate change mitigation strategies. These scenarios do not account for tail events that may be particularly relevant in the short term, such as significant price movements in financial markets or severe extreme weather events. Uncertainties associated with the assumptions made regarding the counterfactual scenario may also have a significant impact on the results.

Financial materiality - Opportunities perspective

The identification and assessment of potential opportunities are based on Allianz business experts’ qualitative evaluations. The identification of potential opportunities is tied to our strategy, as the existence of a strategy to exploit opportunities is a precondition for (likely) materialization. Therefore, strategic initiatives alongside Allianz value chain dimensions, business activities, and sustainability matters play an integral role in identifying opportunities. This ensures any potential opportunity is embedded in our management process as required to pursue the opportunity going forward.

When assessing the opportunities for the Allianz Group, we take into account the likelihood of the occurrence and magnitude of potential financial effects. The actual assessment is conducted by our business experts, who consider qualitative and quantitative information on anticipated effects on Allianz’s financial position, their potential financial performance, or materialization in the short, medium, and long term.

Identifying and assessing climate-related opportunities The identification and assessment of opportunities employs the same qualitative approach described above for all sustainability matters. This means that climate-relevant events are identified over the same short, medium and long term time horizons and assessed using the same methodology, taking into consideration the likelihood and magnitude of the events. The following additions apply to “Climate change” (ESRS E1).

Sustainable Solutions The Sustainable Solutions framework for our Property-Casualty lines is based on regulatory requirements, specifically the E.U. Taxonomy, but also includes additional elements contributing to sustainability objectives beyond climate change adaptation. In developing the Sustainable Solutions Framework, certain guiding principles were defined. One guiding principle is to support customers to mitigate their sustainability risk exposure and to enable the transition of economies and communities. This includes developing and offering insurance products, solutions, and arrangements for low-emission and zero- emission technologies and nature-based solutions key to the net-zero transition. Another principle is to make decisions based on relevant scientific data (e.g., aligning with pathways that limit global warming to 1.5 °C, based on the current IPCC Report). For a summary of the specific criteria of the Sustainable Solutions Framework, see the section E.U. Taxonomy Regulation.

Low-carbon solutions 1 For Allianz’s proprietary insurance business, we have teams sourcing and assessing low-carbon related including strategies on investment and decarbonization in underwriting and investment management, and further strategies on forestry and blended finance within investments. Our low-carbon investment targets are included in the mandates with asset managers, incentivizing investments in low-carbon leaders.

Our approach to financing and insuring the transition is to cluster opportunities by their development stage:

− Identify opportunity: understanding technical solutions, main risks and challenges, cost profile/development, market, main players, and existing investment opportunities.

1_Low-carbon solutions include technologies from Allianz’s Statement on Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy, as well as carbon capture & storage, battery storage- and grid stability-related investments, electric transportation (EV & battery manufacturing plants), electric transportation (electric mass transit

− Develop investment/underwriting approach: exchanging with fund managers/underwriters and risk engineers.

− Conduct first investments/insurance prototypes: implementing first actions, establishing relationships with key market players and partnerships.

− Scale opportunity: scaling investments and underwriting to a significant volume and setting up separately managed accounts to best suit our requirements. Expanding geographical coverage and enhancing our approaches.

The investment management framework used to identify and invest in low-carbon solutions is informed by several climate scenarios, focusing on transition events, underlying technology, and investment volumes. The scenarios considered are similar to those for our emission-related targets and include the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6 C1) and the IEA World Energy Outlook. These scenarios converge on the technologies that need to be scaled to limit global warming. These opportunities are especially material over the short and medium term in the climate scenarios, with pathways typically showing greater variety toward the longer term given that they are not projections.

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Methodology information for climate metrics This section lays out the calculation methodologies for the metrics reported on in the Climate Change section. These entail energy consumption and mix metrics, gross scopes 1, 2, 3, and total GHG emissions metrics. The metrics described in this section have not been separately validated by an external body.

Energy consumption and mix metrics (E1-5)

Energy consumption and mix metrics are disclosed in line with ESRS standard E1-5. They include both energy consumption and production.

Energy consumption

Scope At the Allianz Group, energy consumption data is relevant for our own operations in the offices we occupy, and fully consolidated real estate assets or other real assets in our proprietary investment portfolio. This includes direct in cases where the the underlying project companies are Allianz Group level. Subsidiaries report energy consumption data per building (incl. data centers).

Methodology The Allianz Group collects energy consumption data through direct measurements (e.g., meters), calculations (e.g., invoices), and online tools, with estimates used in most cases where actual data is is unavailable. For Allianz-occupied office buildings, data extrapolated to cover 100 % of the Allianz Group’s workforce.

Energy consumption data for strategic data centers (with over 1 GWh of annual demand) is collected directly, while for local data centers, it is either measured or calculated based on the number of physical servers. Reporting is managed by Allianz Technology or relevant entities, depending on the ownership of the data center.

Total energy consumption at the Allianz Group is comprised of both fossil and renewable energy sources.

159 Methodology Information and Additional Tables

For non-renewable energy sources, we classify all consumed energy that is not explicitly labeled as renewable under fossil sources. This is due to the nature of energy contracts, which are typically categorized as either "green" or not. The non-green contracts may include both fossil and nuclear energy, but we are typically unable to differentiate between the two within our real estate portfolio. This approach ensures a conservative estimate of fossil energy usage. Energy consumption from fossil sources is further broken down into the following categories:

− Fuel consumption from coal and coal products, − Fuel consumption from crude oil and petroleum products, − Fuel consumption from natural gas, − Fuel consumption from other fossil sources, − Purchased or acquired electricity, heat, steam, and cooling from

fossil sources.

On the renewable side, energy consumption is divided into three categories:

− Fuel consumption from renewable sources, such as biogas and biomass,

− Purchased or acquired renewable energy, which includes

electricity, heat, steam, and cooling sourced from renewables, − Self-generated non-fuel renewable energy, which comes from sources like photovoltaics and wind. Given the lack of granular data in our real estate portfolio, we assume all self-generated energy not exported to the grid is consumed by Allianz.

Overall, total renewable energy consumption is the sum of renewable fuel consumption, purchased or acquired renewable energy, and self- generated non-fuel renewable energy.

the Allianz Group encompasses all fossil energy, potential nuclear energy, renewable fuel, purchased/acquired renewable energy, and self-generated renewable energy.

Energy production

Scope The scope of energy production for the Allianz Group is consistent with the scope of energy consumption as outlined above. Energy production within the Allianz Group is largely driven by fully owned

renewable energy assets within our proprietary investment portfolio (wind and solar parks). In addition to these, some of our offices and real estate assets produce renewable energy. However, the amount produced is not material compared to the energy generated by our renewable energy assets and, as such, will not be reported.

Methodology Energy production consists of the electricity produced by Allianz’s renewable energy assets and is measured for each underlying wind and solar PV project after losses.

As Allianz does not produce non-renewable energy, the total energy production is equal to the total renewable energy production.

Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3, and total GHG emissions metrics, including biogenic emissions (E1-6)

Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions metrics

Scope The scope for the Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission metrics is consistent with the scope of the energy metrics.

Overarching methodology For our own operations, as well as fully consolidated real estate assets and renewable energy assets, GHG emission calculations are based on input data such as:

− Energy consumption data, including meter readings or invoice amounts,

−

reporting boundary and buildings, headcount, building floor area, and CO2e conversion factors) and financial data, Input data and calculations from previous years.

Where no primary energy activity data is available, estimation takes place in most cases to fill data gaps. The respective methods are described in more detail in the KPI descriptions below.

Furthermore, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reported for 2023 include estimations for our fully consolidated real assets, where data was extrapolated to cover the necessary reporting periods.

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Scope 1 GHG emissions

Methodology Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company.

There are two sources of GHG emissions that are owned or controlled by the Allianz Group:

− Stationary Combustion: gas and oil heating systems, back-up generators.

− Mobile Combustion: company-owned or leased vehicles.

We also report fugitive emissions for our real estate assets, based on refrigerant top ups over the reporting period.

Scope 2 GHG emissions

Introduction Scope 2 GHG emissions come from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or steam:

− Electricity – Office buildings, real estate, and renewables assets, and data centers.

− District heating and cooling – Office buildings, real estate, and renewables assets.

In line with external requirements by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for accounting for Scope 2 emissions, we use the dual reporting approach to calculate Scope 2 emissions.

Methodology – Gross market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions Gross market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions are calculated in line with our existing carbon accounting approach; emission calculations are performed taking into account the contractual instruments (e.g., Energy Attribute Certificates, green tariffs). For our own operations, there are no Scope 2 market-based emissions associated with electricity consumption, because 100 % of electricity used in our offices is covered by contractual instruments. The electricity mix for Allianz’s renewable energy assets as well as the directly held real estate portfolio of Allianz Switzerland, by contrast, is not readily available, and as such, a conservative approach is taken by assuming market-

160 Methodology Information and Additional Tables

based Scope 2 GHG emissions are the same as the location-based emissions.

Percentage of contractual instruments (Scope 2 GHG emissions) For Allianz’s own operations, the contractual instruments under consideration are:

Unbundled instruments:

− EACs (Energy Attribute Certificates): Purchased locally or through Global Procurement, reflecting the origin and technology of electricity. If the type is unspecified, it is reported as Photovoltaics, the renewable source with the highest Scope 3 emissions. The Allianz Group also buys biomass EACs.

Bundled instruments:

− Green Tariffs: Agreements at the building level that confirm the percentage of renewable energy consumed, typically 100 %. The Allianz Group uses green tariffs for renewable electricity and biogas.

− Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): Contracts between a generator and buyer that guarantee a steady revenue for renewable projects.

The proportion of these instruments changes annually based on energy sourcing. Where possible, Allianz procures its green electricity through green tariffs for its real estate. However, detailed reporting data is not yet readily available. We will continue to pursue detailed data on this metric and monitor developments carefully.

For each KPI, we report the Scope 2 energy consumption covered by the relevant contractual instruments as a percentage of Allianz Own Operations Scope 2 energy consumption.

Percentage of energy consumption covered by contractual instruments This KPI reflects the percentage of Scope 2 energy consumption covered by all contractual instruments, either bundled or unbundled, i.e., it is the sum of the following two KPIs.

Percentage of energy consumption covered by bundled contractual instruments We purchase energy bundled with attributes from external suppliers and the percentages differ from year to year, due to changes in energy sourcing. The percentage is disclosed every year, reflecting the reported consumption data covered by bundled instruments. All energy consumption in the analysis (e.g., heating, electricity).

Percentage of energy consumption covered by unbundled contractual instruments This refers to EACs as defined above, for which a percentage will be disclosed. The percentage is disclosed every year, reflecting the reported consumption data covered by unbundled instruments (EACs). All energy consumption is included in the analysis (e.g., heating, electricity).

Percentage of energy consumption not covered by contractual instruments This is the balancing item for the previous three metrics, i.e., the Scope 2 energy consumption by the Allianz Group not covered by any contractual instruments.

Gross location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions To fulfil the requirements of the “location-based” method for Scope 2 reporting, we also calculate and publish Scope 2 GHG emissions on the basis of grid-average emission factors (national, based on IEA, preliminary version, or state-level for U.S. assets based on EPA data) applied to Scope 2 energy consumed (which includes electricity from the grid).

Biogenic emissions of CO₂ from combustion or bio-degradation of biomass Biogenic emissions refer to emissions from purchased energy generated from the combustion of biogas and biomass. In line with the GHG Protocol and expectations of ESRS, biogenic emissions are disclosed outside of overall GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) for Allianz Own Operations and are calculated using the relevant emission factor. For our real estate and renewable energy assets, data is not available at a sufficiently granular level to separate biogenic emissions.

Scope 3 GHG emissions

Scope Scope 3 GHG emissions consist of indirect emissions that occur in our company’s upstream and downstream value chain, and most significantly of the companies we insure and invest in, in line with the GHG Protocol.

Methodology – Total gross indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions Total gross indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions (tCO₂eq) are calculated as the sum of all categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions across our upstream and downstream value chain.

Category 1 – Purchased goods and services This consists of paper and public cloud services. Paper use is monitored and reported for internal or external purposes, with the following environmental attributes:

− Paper from certified sustainable sources – recycled or virgin fibers, and

− Paper from non-certified sources.

Methodology − Paper: Data is based on invoice amounts (where available) and

estimations from entities.

− Public cloud services: Emission data is either directly provided by the public cloud service providers or calculated based on spend and a corresponding CO₂e conversion factor, which is based on carbon intensity data from comparable public cloud providers. The conversion factor is reviewed on an annual basis in order to reflect changes with regard to the carbon intensity (e.g., an increase of renewable electricity in the data centers of the public cloud providers).

Category 3 – Fuel-and Energy-related Activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2):

Methodology The Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with fuel and energy-related activities are calculated based on the emission factors provided by VfU (or renewable electricity and renewable heating, fossil fuel-based district heating), and DESNZ (fossil fuels), corresponding to the Well- to-Tank and Transmission and Distribution loss emissions for all energy

161 Methodology Information and Additional Tables

consumed by the Allianz Group entities. For district heating, where local data is available (e.g., supplier document), the local factor is applied; where Scope 3 GHG emissions are not already specifically included in the local factor, a value equivalent to 2 % is added (note: Scope 2 emissions value represents 98 %).

Category 6 – Business travel This consists of emissions from air, rail, and car travel.

Methodology − Air travel: Business flights data is based on actual distance traveled and/or the costs. Data here is split into short (< 500 km) and long-haul flights (> 500 km) and reported distance per sub- indicator is multiplied by the corresponding short-haul or long- haul emission factor.

− Train travel: Emissions from train travel are calculated based on the actual distance traveled and/or the cost multiplied by the appropriate CO₂e conversion factor.

− Road travel: Emissions from cars are calculated based on the actual distance traveled and/or the cost multiplied by the appropriate CO₂e conversion factor.

Emission factors for calculating Scope 3 category 6 are based on the DESNZ database and include Well-to-Tank emissions for all sources. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is reported in accordance with best-

practice and guidance.

Category 7 – Employee commuting This consists only of emissions from remote working. Since 2022, once remote working became more material, GHG emissions from remote working have been included in our environmental reporting. Remote working is linked to heating, cooling, lighting, and IT.

Methodology The scope of remote working emissions is based on energy consumption linked to heating, cooling, lighting, and IT, and is calculated using:

− The Flexible Working Metric (%), − Country-specific energy intensities values, and − Average remote working area.

The energy consumption for remote working is then converted into GHG emissions (Scope 3) on the following basis:

− Remote working electricity: the IEA market mix at country level. − Remote working heating/cooling: district heating/cooling factors.

It should be noted that remote working-related energy is in scope of the Allianz Group GHG emissions targets and out of scope of the Allianz Group share of renewable electricity targets and energy in office buildings targets.

Category 13 – Downstream leased assets This refers to the operation of assets owned by an Allianz company (lessor) and leased to other entities in the reporting year. Emissions in this category are those not included in the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reported by the lessor, i.e., they are emissions from the lessee over the reporting period, and may also include emissions from sub- leased spaces if under control of the sub-lessee. Downstream leased assets therefore refers to tenant emissions. Where the Allianz Group fully consolidates a real estate investment, we allocate tenants' controlled emissions to Scope 3 category 13.

Methodology Emissions are calculated using a similar approach to that described below in the section on category 15 on Directly Owned Real Estate (Not Fully Consolidated Assets). For fully consolidated downstream leased assets, Allianz recognizes 100 % of Scope 3 GHG emissions.

Category 15 – Financed emissions

Financed emissions – Proprietary Investments

General statement The Allianz Group calculates financed emissions for corporates, public debt, and real estate held on the balance sheet, excluding cash and securitized products (like ABS/MBS and Covered Bonds) due to the absence of relevant methodologies.

Our methodologies were defined in line with the SFDR Final Report on Draft Regulatory Technical Standards and the NZ AOA Target Setting Protocol. Allianz also the recommendations set out in the Global GHG Accounting & Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry (PCAF) to ensure robust climate- related financial reporting.

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

− Enterprise Value Including Cash (EVIC): The company's market capitalization and debt at year-end, without deducting cash or cash equivalents. This avoids negative enterprise values and ensures 100 % of the company’s emissions are attributed to equity and debt holders. For not-listed corporates, EVIC is calculated using the company’s Net Asset Value (NAV) and gross debt. − PPP-adjusted GDP: This GDP value is used to fairly compare countries' economic output, as a proxy for the sovereign’s, sub- sovereign’s, and supranational’s value, adjusting for exchange rate effects. This is used in place of the EVIC for financed emissions of public debt.

We calculate our financed emissions using financial data from the end of the financial year (31 December) and GHG emissions data, which typically have a one-to-two-year time lag. This approach aligns with global standards such as the PCAF Standard. The Allianz Group reports on KPIs like absolute financed emissions and carbon intensity to track decarbonization progress and compare investments or sectors.

Methodology – absolute financed emissions of corporates and public debt The methodology below applies to corporates and public debt.

Financed emissions represent the share of a company’s or entity's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are attributed to the Allianz Group based on the proportion of financing provided by the Allianz Group, relative to the entity’s total value. These emissions are calculated annually.

Scope We use three methodologies for calculating financed emissions, defined by the underlying investments. The table below shows the scope per asset class. Cash, derivatives, and unit-linked products 1 are excluded from our financed emissions calculation.

The key inputs to this metric are:

− Investment value (€ investment): The Allianz Group’s financial exposure to a company or issuer. The approach to measuring this differs by asset class. It is measured as the market value for equity investments and the nominal bond value for debt investments (exception: market value for zero-coupon bonds).

The absolute financed emissions of our portfolio are then calculated by determining the ratio of the Allianz Group’s exposure to the company or entity (based on size of investment) relative to the company or entity’s total value (ppp-adjusted GDP for Public Debt). This ratio is then multiplied by the company or entity’s total emissions (measured in carbon dioxide equivalents, CO₂e). The coverage figure shows the percentage of total book value for which financed emissions are available.

− Issuer emissions: Total Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions of the company as per the GHG Protocol. For Scope 3 emissions we have included an estimate range for the magnitude of the Scope 3 of Scope 3 emissions. We will continue to monitor developments in this area, and develop our disclosures as more robust Scope 3 emissions disclosures become available. For listed equity investments, bonds from and loans to listed and not-listed privately owned corporates as well as corporates owned by sovereigns, sub-sovereigns, and municipals, when no emissions data are available, the issuer (i.e. corporates and corporate-like issuers) is assigned to a NACE sector, and sector average emissions based on the Allianz Group portfolio are calculated by dividing the sum of emissions by the sum of EVIC for companies in the same sector. The sector average is then used to estimate a company's emissions. Investors rely on investees disclosing carbon footprint information, which then needs to be onboarded by data providers. With CSRD coming into effect, we expect data availability to improve.

Since there is no guidance from PCAF or other carbon accounting standards for calculating financed emissions of bonds from and loans to sub-sovereign and supranationals, the Allianz Group has adapted the methodology used for sovereigns.

Methodology – Financed emissions of real estate Financed emissions represent the share of a real estate investment’s GHG emissions that are attributed to the Allianz Group based on the proportion of financing provided by the Allianz Group, relative to the entity’s total value. These emissions are calculated annually.

The key inputs to this metric are:

− Investment value (€ Investment):

− For public debt, issuer emissions consist of Scope 1 GHG emissions, which equal production emissions from within the country but exclude land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF), due to data uncertainty.

− Directly Owned Real Estate Equity and Funds: Ownership share based on market value.

− Commercial Real Estate Loans and Retail Mortgages: Outstanding loan amount.

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

− Considered emissions:

− Scope 1: Natural gas, fuel oil, refrigerant losses (landlord emissions from directly held investments and JVs > 50 % share). − Scope 2: Purchased electricity, district heating/cooling, geothermal energy (landlord emissions from directly held investments, and JVs > 50 % share).

− Scope 3: Scope 1 and 2 emission sources from “Downstream leased assets” from Directly held (tenant emissions investments and JVs > 50 % share) and “Investments” (tenant and landlord emissions from JVs ≤ 50 % share), Distribution losses (from directly held investments and JVs > 50 % share).

Out of scope are non-operational emissions (e.g., capital goods) and emissions from distribution losses originated in Joint Ventures with ≤ 50 % share.

− For Directly Owned Real Estate Equity: Emissions are calculated by assessing Allianz's ownership share and converting activity data into emissions values using specific coefficients.

into Real Estate Equity: Emissions are calculated based on Allianz's ownership share of the fund and the total emissions of the buildings, sourced from fund manager reports. The Allianz Group does not calculate emissions data for indirect equity using Real Estate funds, as the necessary data (e.g., consumption, floor area) is not available. The Allianz Group therefore applies reasonable effort, such as by contacting its fund managers, to obtain financed emissions data for the indirect equity from reports created by the fund manager. Preferably, such reports are confirmed by an independent auditor. In cases where the necessary information is not provided by the fund managers, we are unable to include GHG data for these indirect equity investments in our reporting.

1_The global GHG Accounting & Reporting Standard Part C – Insurance-Associated Emissions (carbonaccountingfinancials.com).

163 Methodology Information and Additional Tables

− For Commercial Real Estate Loans: Emissions are calculated by applying the ratio of Allianz’s outstanding loan to the building’s Net Asset Value (NAV), attributing a portion of the building’s total emissions to the Allianz Group. The Allianz Group does not directly calculate emissions based on consumption data for assets financed using Commercial Real Estate Loans (CREL), as the necessary data is not available. The Allianz Group therefore instead applies reasonable effort to obtain financed emissions data for the assets financed from reports created by the borrower. Preferably such reports are confirmed by an independent auditor. If the required information is not provided, no GHG data can be reported for these loans.

− Retail Mortgages: Emissions are reported for the assets where Allianz Leben has energy performance certificates.

Green bonds Green bonds are a special case in the process of our financed emissions calculation. These are bonds where the money raised by the issuer is used exclusively to finance projects that have a positive environmental impact, such as funding further development of renewable energy or green buildings. We apply a percentage factor (currently 10 %) to the emissions of green bonds in the calculation of financed emissions. This is, in general, a conservative approach, which has been validated utilizing use of proceeds-based MSCI data for Green Bonds. Green bonds are identified via a respective flag from our data provider. Further information on the methodology used for Green bonds can be found in the Explanatory Notes on the Allianz company website.

Insurance – associated emissions – Commercial Underwriting Portfolio While we deem IAE not mandatory under E1 of the ESRS, we have developed entity-specific metrics to report these emissions, based on the methodology of PCAF 1.

Annual Report 2024 − Allianz Group

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

Methodology – Insurance-associated emissions We calculate IAE by determining a policyholder’s proportional GHG emissions (CO₂e) based on the share of insurance premiums they pay relative to their revenues. This calculation uses the ratio of the customer’s insurance premium to their total revenues (attribution factor) and is multiplied by their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (as defined by the GHG Protocol). Scope 3 GHG emissions are excluded for now due to data reliability but may be included later. The total portfolio IAE is the sum of all insurance policies’ IAE in the portfolio.

Key inputs for the IAE calculation include:

Insurance premiums: Defined as Insurance Revenue, net of acquisition costs (brokerage, commissions).

− Customer emissions: Based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions sourced from MSCI and Refinitiv, or parent company emissions if the subsidiary data is unavailable.

− Customer revenues: The total income generated from selling goods or services, sourced from Refinitiv (now LSEG).

The portfolio’s IAE are calculated annually. For customer revenues and GHG emissions, the most recent data from our external data providers (MSCI and Refinitiv) is used, going back up to four reporting years. The customer’s insurance premium data is taken from internal data sources for the current reporting period.

The portfolio emission intensity is calculated as IAE per volume of insurance premiums (in €). The intensity metric helps track portfolio decarbonization over time.

We apply a 10 % emission reduction factor to the IAE on insurance policies insuring technologies in line with the Allianz statement on renewable/low carbon energy. This methodology applies until more specific methodologies for renewable & low carbon solutions become available. This means that, for these policies (and the associated insurance premium), only 10 % of IAE are considered.

Emissions and revenue data provided by our external data providers are checked for accuracy by cross-referencing a representative sample with customer annual reports. Outliers with significant impact of the portfolio’s IAE are manually adjusted.

Based on the applicable PCAF standard, a data quality score is calculated for each insurance policy, depending on whether emissions and revenues are reported at the customer or parent level (score 2 for customer-level data and score 4 for parent-level data).

164 Methodology Information and Additional Tables

Portfolio coverage indicates the proportion of the commercial portfolio subject to the emissions reduction target, calculated using the Insurance Revenue. Currently, the coverage is the total Insurance Revenue of the target sub-portfolio divided by the total Insurance Revenue of in-scope Property-Casualty commercial lines of business at Allianz.

Insurance-associated emissions – Motor Retail Underwriting Portfolio

Scope – Vehicle types in scope car,” According “motorcycle/motorbike/moped,” “passenger van,” “passenger truck,” and “motorhome” are in scope for Personal Motor.

Since it is the responsibility of each insurance company to define the specific vehicle types which they include in their respective inventories of IAE, the Allianz Group follows the E.U. classification of vehicle types.

Methodology – Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of vehicles To calculate and report the IAE for motor retail portfolios, only Scope 1 (direct emissions from fuel combustion) and Scope 2 (indirect GHG emissions from electricity consumption for electric vehicles) are considered. Scope 3 GHG emissions, such as those related to vehicle production or maintenance, are excluded from this calculation.

IAE are apportioned to the insurer using an attribution factor, which accounts for the share of vehicle costs covered by insurance relative to total vehicle ownership costs (e.g., depreciation, fuel, maintenance, and taxes). The global attribution factor for motor retail insurance is 6.99 % and is published by PCAF, updated at least once every five years.

The quality of the data used to calculate emissions is classified into five levels, with Score 1 being the highest and Score 5 the lowest. If a mix of data sources is used (e.g., actual distance travelled but average emission intensity), the overall quality score is based on the lower-rated option. The Allianz Group prefers vehicle-level data but may use local or continental averages when necessary.

For cars with combustion engines, CO₂ emissions data (Scope 1) of the vehicle is used, while for electric vehicles, the electricity consumption of the vehicle is multiplied by the electricity emission factor for the country to calculate the Scope 2 GHG emissions. For plug-in hybrid vehicles, both Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are calculated. If detailed data is unavailable, averages are used, leading

to a lower data quality score. For example, if actual distance travelled is not available, the province/state/country are used, followed by average values for the province/state/country.

Actions to improve data accuracy include at least annual reviews on the availability of local data, as well as averages provided centrally; subsidiaries are also encouraged to submit new/better data sources for review as soon as they are known/available, all to ensure the most recent and reliable data is used. A key action within our further portfolio changes lever is to also focus on mileage-based products, which will allow subsidiaries to collect vehicle level data, thereby improving their data accuracy for pricing and emissions reporting.

Data on insurance premiums and emissions is reported quarterly by subsidiaries, which is then used to monitor progress against plan. External reporting occurs annually and includes the current year emissions and 2022 baseline (MtCO₂), coverage percentage (%), and the data quality score.

Emissions are reported with a one-year lag in line with the PCAF standard, meaning 2022 emissions were calculated using 2021 data. The coverage percentage reflects the share of premiums in the baseline portfolio that are included in the emissions reduction target. It is calculated as the ratio of the total premiums for the baseline portfolio compared to the total premiums of the Motor Retail line of business.

Emissions reporting is aligned with the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). For vehicles with emissions values based on the older New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard, a conversion factor was developed by comparing WLTP and NEDC values from 2017 to 2020.

When specific vehicle data is unavailable, averages for emission intensity and distance travelled are used, sourced from databases like the European Energy Agency (EEA), GOV.uk, Australia’s National Transport Commission (NTC), and the International Energy Agency (IEA). For distance travelled, averages are based on national statistics or global sources like OECD-ITF and the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).

These averages result in varying data quality scores depending on granularity. For example, country-level data by vehicle type achieves a Score 2, while global averages lead to a Score 4.

Total GHG emissions

Methodology – Total GHG emissions (location- and market- based) The total GHG emissions figure is the sum of the Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions of the Allianz Group. This figure is disclosed twice, once using the market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions and once using the location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions, according to the definitions below.

− Total GHG emissions market-based (t CO₂eq) = Gross Scope 1 + Gross Scope 2 market-based + Gross Scope 3.

− Total GHG emissions location-based (t CO₂eq) = Gross Scope 1 + Gross Scope 2 location-based + Gross Scope 3.

Methodology – GHG emissions intensity (location- and market- based) Overall GHG emissions intensity for the Allianz Group is disclosed as an overarching figure representing GHG emissions per million euros of business volume.

The calculation is repeated twice, once using the market-based total absolute emissions of the Allianz Group, and once using the location-based total absolute emissions of the Allianz Group. The total absolute emissions used for these calculations do not include IAE or SAF. For both of the calculations, the total business volumes figure used is the same.

Methodology – Percentage of Scope 3 GHG emissions calculated using primary data (%) For Scope 3 GHG emissions, we disclose the percentage of emissions calculated using primary data obtained from suppliers or other value chain partners. We calculate the percentage of Scope 3 GHG emissions calculated using primary data separately for Allianz Own Operations and proprietary investments and then aggregate this to the Allianz Group level as a weighted average for the Allianz Group’s overall Scope 3 GHG emissions.

Sustainable Investments

Scope – asset classes in scope All asset classes are in scope, aside from cash and derivatives.

Methodology The methodology to identify sustainable investments focuses on E.U. Taxonomy-aligned activities and SFDR criteria.

Investment This data-driven approach, managed by Allianz Management investments, evaluates investments based on three criteria, all of which need to be met for the investment to be considered sustainable:

− positive environmental/social objectives, − adherence to "do no significant harm" principles, and − good governance practices.

The specific requirements to meet each criterion vary by asset class. The Allianz Group supplements the SFDR-defined principle adverse impact indicators for companies, sovereigns, and real estate by using internal screenings for renewable and infrastructure investments and confirming SFDR Article 9 compliance or equivalent criteria for funds, while continuously seeking new data sources to address gaps and enhance understanding of adverse impacts, despite limitations in data availability.

167 Allianz ESRS Policies

C _ Group Management Report _ Sustainability Statement

The following contains a description of the overarching ESRS policies of Allianz that address more than one sustainability matter or value chain component at the same time. A detailed description of further ESRS policies of Allianz not covered in this section can be found in the respective topical sections as outlined in the table above.

Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability (ASIS)

The ASIS outlines principles, rules, processes, roles, and responsibilities for integrating sustainability topics at Allianz Group. It applies to new and renewal local underwriting function, and proprietary investments in non-listed asset classes 1.

The Standard aims to identify business activities that may trigger sustainability issues and, where appropriate, to take action to minimize their probability and/or impact. This is managed through the SBAs (and Guidelines), the SCL, the Energy Guidelines (reflecting Allianz’s Statements on Coal, Oil sands, and Oil & gas-based business models), and the sustainability due diligence and referral process, in line with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UNGP on Business and Human Rights. The due diligence and referral process is a case-specific assessment, requiring potentially sensitive business to be screened on a transaction-by-transaction basis and referred for detailed sustainability assessment if necessary. The SBAs and Guidelines were developed in 2013 through dialogue with internal and external stakeholders (NGOs). For each of the twelve SBAs, across “Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry”, “Agricultural Commodities investments”, “Animal Welfare”, “Betting and Gambling”, “Clinical Trials”, “Animal Testing”, “Defense” (which outlines Allianz’s restrictions for banned/controversial weapons), “Hydro-electric Power”, “Infrastructure”, “Mining”, “Nuclear Energy”, “Oil and Gas”, and “Sex industry”, SBGs were developed based on internationally recognized standards and best practices, such as the International Finance Corporation’s Environmental & Social Performance Standards, International Hydropower Association Sustainability Protocol, and the core ILO conventions. The Guidelines comprise criteria that assist all parties in screening transactions and identifying potential and/or actual sustainability issues. Examples of screening criteria include impacts to protected areas, deforestation, pollution such as oil spills,

1_Investments in non-listed asset classes include: real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy, private equity, private placements.

human rights violations, and impacts to local communities (for further information, please refer to the Sustainability Integration Framework). The SCL identifies transactions in countries with systematic human rights violations, such as corruption and rule of law, requiring additional human rights due diligence. Criteria to determine sensitive countries are based on international human rights assessments and indices.

The on banned/controversial weapons. Allianz prohibits proprietary investments in and does not insure companies involved in the development, production, maintenance, and trading of certain types of controversial weapons. Banned or controversial weapons are those that fall under the scope of the following international conventions:

− Anti-personnel landmines as defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (Ottawa Treaty). − Cluster munitions as defined in Article 2 of the Convention on

Cluster Munitions.

− Biological and toxin weapons as defined in Article I of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production (Biological) and Toxin and Stockpiling of Bacteriological Weapons and on (Biological Weapons Convention).

− Chemical weapons as defined in Article 11 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (Chemical Weapons Convention).

When negative sustainability impacts related to a (potential) transaction are identified in one of the SBAs during screening, a referral is triggered. The transaction then undergoes a subsidiary, and/or Group-level sustainability assessment, following with a decision to either (i) proceed with the transaction, (ii) proceed with binding conditions, or (iii) decline the business transaction.

The ASIS is mandatory for all Allianz entities conducting the following business activities: Property-Casualty commercial insurance business, Corporate/Group Life/Health insurance business, and non- listed proprietary investments. The key processes of the Standard are available for external stakeholders in the Sustainability Integration Framework published on the Allianz website.

The ASIS is owned by Global Sustainability, endorsed by the Group Sustainability Board and the member of the Board of Management of Allianz SE in charge of the division Investment Management, Sustainability, and acknowledged by the Board of Management of Allianz SE.

Allianz Group Risk Policy (GRP)

The GRP outlines the general aspects of the Group’s risk management framework. It covers all material risks related to insurance, proprietary investments, asset management, and our own operations.

The GRP describes the core risk management principles, processes, and key definitions to manage all material risks within the Group Risk appetite. These include identified material environmental, social, and governance risks.

The GRP sets out as a key objective of the risk function to monitor the risk profile so that it remains within the defined risk appetite and to follow up on any breaches. For this purpose, all material risks are measured using consistent quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantifiable risks are covered within the scope of the risk capital framework of Allianz. Single risks that cannot be quantified based on the risk capital methodology, as well as complex risk structures resulting from a combination of several risks from one or more risk categories, are assessed with the help of qualitative criteria and a less elaborate approach such as scenario analysis. Strictly unquantifiable risks are analyzed based on qualitative criteria.

The risk strategy and corresponding risk appetite are transferred limit management processes covering all into standardized quantifiable risks throughout the Group. A limit breach reporting and escalation process ensures that risk tolerance limits and target ratings for top risks (including non-quantifiable risks) are adhered to and that, as appropriate, remediation activities are taken immediately if limits are exceeded.

To achieve the first objective, Allianz subsidiaries are required to set underwriting criteria, engage with (potential) clients on GHG emitting activities, and develop insurance offerings for low-emission and zero- emission technologies. To achieve

− Lawful Basis, Transparency, and Security: Process personal data only with a lawful basis, maintain transparency with individuals, ensure through appropriate safeguards, and protect personal data during transfers.

To manage sustainability-related risks, Allianz conducts an annual assessment of how various ESG events and conditions could materially together with a its business processes, corresponding assessment of the adequacy of risk mitigation frameworks or other existing response measures. This assessment serves as the basis of the financial materiality assessment for this report.

− Accountability and Compliance: Only maintain relationships with data processors that adhere to privacy requirements, report data breaches in a timely manner, implement privacy by design and by default, and cooperate with data protection authorities.

the second objective, all Property-Casualty underwriting activities must be carried out in a responsible and forward-looking way by identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks associated with sustainability-related issues. Further details on the referral process, the SBAs (and Guidelines), and the SCL can be found in Sections C and D of the ASIS.

Early warning systems, such as the monitoring of limits for high risks, the consideration of emerging risks during performance of the top risk assessment, and new product approval processes are established to identify new and emerging risks, including complex risk structures. Risks identified through early warning systems are subject to continuous monitoring and regular reviews and, where appropriate, pre-emptive risk mitigation techniques.

The APS sets out global minimum data protection and privacy requirements for the processing of personal data by all Allianz subsidiaries and legal entities and their employees within the Allianz Group. The APS is mandatory for all Allianz subsidiaries and employees, who are legally bound to comply with its requirements.

To foster climate-related opportunities within Property-Casualty insurance, Allianz developed the Sustainable Solutions framework, which is governed by the ASU. Further information on Sustainable Solutions can be found in section E.U. Taxonomy Regulation.

The ASU is mandatory for all Allianz subsidiaries underwriting Property-Casualty business.

It also applies to third parties such as vendors. Vendors may only process personal data on behalf of the Allianz Group on the basis of a written agreement that sets forth the vendor’s obligations under Allianz policies, including, but not limited to, onward transfers; the appointment of sub-processors; rights and obligations regarding the confidentiality, return, and destruction of personal data; technical and organizational security measures; breach notification obligations; data subject rights; and data privacy audits.

Group Risk is the owner of the GRP and is responsible for maintaining and updating the policy and monitoring its implementation. The most senior level that is accountable for the implementation of the policy is the Group CRO.

The Group Underwriting Committee (GUC) is the owner of the ASU. Responsibility for Property-Casualty underwriting governance resides with the Allianz SE Board Members in charge of Allianz SE division Insurance German Speaking Countries, Central Europe, Global P&C, and division Global Insurance Lines, Reinsurance, Anglo Markets, Iberia, Latin America, Africa; it is executed via the GUC, Allianz SE Insurance German-Speaking Countries, Central Europe, Global P&C Underwriting Governance, and AGCS SE as delegated by division Global Insurance Lines, Reinsurance, Anglo Markets, Iberia, Latin America, Africa.

Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU)

The ASU governs the rules and principles for Property-Casualty underwriting within the Allianz Group, including those related to sustainability.

The member of the Allianz SE Board of Management in charge of the division Operations, IT and Organization is assigned overall responsibility for Group Privacy. Group Privacy is the owner of the APS and is responsible for maintaining and implementing the APS.

The ASU addresses the following objectives related to sustainability:

Allianz Privacy Standard (APS)

− Take corporate responsibility for our planet, for communities, societies, and future generations, including the Allianz Group’s commitment to transition all operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as related (intermediate) targets.

Allianz Functional Rule for Sustainability in Investments (FRSI)

The APS defines rules and requirements for collecting and processing the personal data of individuals, including our employees and related staff, customers, business partners, or any other third parties whose personal data is processed by Allianz.

The FRSI sets the rules, principles, and processes for the integration of environmental, social, and governance topics into the investment management function.

The objective of the FRSI is to align the identification, assessment, and management of sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities for the proprietary investment assets with the Allianz transition plan, applicable sustainability regulation, and other relevant Group policies (e.g., ASIS).

The APS sets out the following privacy principles:

its entities against risks associated with environmental, social, and governance issues and reputational risks.

− Due Care and Data Quality: Ensure personal data is handled lawfully, fairly, and transparently, adhering to principles of purpose limitation, data minimization, and storage limitation.

− Develop sustainable business opportunities through enabling the transition of economies and communities.

Sustainability governance is fully integrated into existing governance structures and makes use of existing committees (e.g., the Group Investment Committee). Allianz SE is a signatory of the United Nations-backed PRI since August 2011. As a signatory, Allianz is committed to promoting the Principles within the Allianz Group and amongst industry peers. Therefore, the FRSI considers and closely follows the PRI recommendations. We deem the framework laid out by the UN-convened NZAOA for target-setting to be best practice. Thus, we generally follow the recommendations of the NZAOA for setting intermediate decarbonization targets.

It addresses the core principles of procurement, main processes, and roles and responsibilities. As defined, the core principles of procurement are:

− Ensure realization of economies of scale. − Ensure freedom from conflicts of interest. − Ensure confidentiality. − Ensure internal vetting process and verified fact-based decision-

— Ensure internal vetting process and verified fact-based decision- making

The FRSI is mandatory for all Allianz insurance and reinsurance entities, including related pension schemes and all types of investment assets.

AIM SE – and Group Treasury and Corporate Finance insofar as Allianz SE (solo) is concerned – is the owner of the FRSI and responsible for maintaining and updating the FRSI. All material changes need approval by the Member of the Board of Management of Allianz SE in charge of the division Investment Management, and, insofar as Allianz SE (solo) is concerned, the Group Finance and Risk Committee.

The AGSP is mandatory for all business functions and procurement functions within the Allianz Group with the exception of Allianz Asset Management (AAM). The member of the Board of Management of Allianz SE in charge of the division Operations, IT and Organization has the overall responsibility for procurement. Within Operations, IT and Organization, Global Sourcing and Procurement is the owner of the AGSP, and responsible for maintaining and updating the Standard.

1. Les activités alignées sur la taxonomie sont principalement concentrées sur l'atténuation du changement climatique, avec un ratio de 1,44 % du chiffre d'affaires correspondant à un montant monétaire de 10,7 milliards d'euros. En termes de dépenses d'investissement (Capex), cela représente un ratio de 1,87 % et un montant de 13,8 milliards d'euros.

2. Les activités transitoires et habilitantes contribuent également à l'atténuation du changement climatique, mais dans une moindre mesure. Les activités transitoires représentent un ratio de 0,03 % du chiffre d'affaires (0,2 milliard d'euros) et 0,06 % du Capex (0,4 milliard d'euros). Les activités habilitantes représentent un ratio de 0,21 % du chiffre d'affaires (1,6 milliard d'euros) et 0,33 % du Capex (2,4 milliards d'euros).

3. Les autres catégories d'activités alignées sur la taxonomie, telles que l'adaptation au changement climatique, la protection de l'eau et des milieux marins, la transition vers une économie circulaire, la prévention de la pollution, et la protection de la biodiversité et des écosystèmes, ne présentent pas de données chiffrées dans ce tableau.

4. Une note en bas de tableau précise que les quotas totaux d'alignement pour le chiffre d'affaires et le Capex ne sont pas entièrement attribués aux objectifs d'atténuation et d'adaptation au changement climatique en raison de limitations dans les données concernant les investissements des entreprises.
