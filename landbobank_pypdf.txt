Question: Quel est le plan de transition pour l'atténuation du changement climatique ? Pour répondre à cette question, nous souhaitons avoir une description brève des principaux leviers de décarbonation, du plan d'investissement et de financement du plan de transition, et de la comptabilité avec un scénario 1,5°C ou 2°C.


Context: Parmi les informations que nous recherchons, nous pouvons lister les éléments suivants : <br><br>Plan de transition est aligné avec un scénario 1,5°C. <br><br>Leviers de décarbonation programmés. <br><br>Plan d'investissement et de financement des leviers de décarbonation. <br><br>Alignement de la stratégie et le plan de financement. <br><br>Suivi des progrès.


Answer: Le plan de transition pour l'atténuation du changement climatique de la banque s'articule autour de plusieurs leviers de décarbonation. Les principaux efforts se concentrent sur la réduction des émissions de CO2e provenant des prêts et investissements (scope 3), qui représentent la majorité des émissions totales de la banque. La banque vise une réduction de 45 % des émissions par DKK million prêté et de 50 % par DKK million investi entre 2020 et 2030. Pour ses propres opérations (scopes 1 et 2), la banque a pour objectif de diminuer les émissions de 60 % entre 2019 et 2030.

En termes de plan d'investissement et de financement, la banque met en œuvre des initiatives qualitatives, telles que des dialogues climatiques avec certains clients, le scoring ESG des investissements, et propose de nouveaux outils et offres de produits ESG. La banque considère le financement d'actifs durables, comme les énergies renouvelables et l'efficacité énergétique, comme une opportunité majeure pour réduire les émissions de CO2e.

Concernant la compatibilité avec un scénario de réchauffement climatique de 1,5°C ou 2°C, le plan de transition de la banque soutient la loi européenne sur le climat et l'objectif de l'Accord de Paris de limiter l'augmentation de la température mondiale. Cependant, bien que l'analyse des risques du plan soit alignée avec ces scénarios climatiques, le lien direct entre le scénario climatique et l'impact sur les activités de prêt de la banque n'a pas encore été entièrement quantifié.

		 Source:The transition plan describes the bank’s targets and
initiatives for reducing CO 2e emissions towards 2030 and
for achieving climate neutrality by 2050.
The indirect CO 2e emissions from loans and investments
(scope 3) account for almost all of the bank’s total CO 2e
emissions and are therefore focus areas in the transition
plan. In 2023, the bank set the sub -targets of reducing
CO 2e emissions by 45% per DKK million lent and by 50%
per DKK million invested in the period 2020  - 2030.
These targets took into account reductions already
achieved at society level. At EU level, CO 2e emissions
were reduced by 32% in the period 1990 -2020. To achieve
a   % reduction by 2030, which is the EU’s target,
emissions in the EU must therefore be reduced by a
further 34% in the period 2020  - 2030. Against this
background, the bank’s targets for CO 2e reductions are
consistent with both the European Climate Law and the
Paris Agreement.
In setting the targets, it was essential that the bank can
continue its organic growth strategy and win additional
market share. The quantitative targets set for 2030 are
therefore intensity -based.
For the period until 2030, the bank has implemented and
planned a range of qualitative initiatives in the work
towards the CO 2e targets. They include climate dialogues
with certain customers, ESG scoring of investments, new
ESG tools and product offers.
The bank will evaluate the initiatives on an ongoing basis
and implement any necessary additional initiatives in the
work towards reducing CO 2e emissions, including setting
five-year sub -targets from 2030 until the 2050 target.
In 2024, the bank set the target that CO 2e emissions from
the bank’s own operations (scope 1 and 2) should be
reduced by 60% in the period 2019 -2030. No embedded
CO 2e emissions of significance are judged to exist. The
bank has implemented and planned various initiatives to
reduce emissions from its own operations.

Transition plan
(E1-1)
The corporate social responsibility and sustainability
policy is implemented via a separate transition plan for
climate and the environment approved by the bank’s
board of directors and published on the bank’s website.
The transition plan describes the bank’s targets and
initiatives for reducing CO 2e emissions towards 2030 and
for achieving climate neutrality by 2050.
The indirect CO 2e emissions from loans and investments
(scope 3) account for almost all of the bank’s total CO 2e
emissions and are therefore focus areas in the transition
plan. In 2023, the bank set the sub -targets of reducing
CO 2e emissions by 45% per DKK million lent and by 50%

		 Source:risks, primarily in the bank’s lending business in the
downstream value chain.
As stated in the “Transition plan” section on page 66, the
bank has set its climate targets in support of the
European Climate Law and the aim of the Paris
Agreement to keep the global temperature rise below 2
degrees and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5
degrees above pre -industrial level. The b ank’s analysis of
risks was carried out in accordance with the above
climate scenario  even though  the link between the
climate scenario and the effect on the bank’s lending
business has not yet been qua ntified, due to lack of CO 2e
emission data for the bank’s borrowers.  The bank also
follows financial sector analyses.
The time horizon and rate of change are decisive for the
risks facing the bank. A large part of the bank’s loans will
thus have been repaid over a 10 -year horizon and the
bank is generally judged to be robust to changes
occurring gradually over a period of 10 years or more.
The changes in the physical climate are therefore not
judged to pose any major risk per se. Climate change can
reach the financial system faster, howeve r. The value of
assets, e.g. real property, may thus decrease due to
future expectations, and regulatory change can affect the
values of security provided.

		 Source:For example, agreements have been entered into on
carbon taxes on emissions in industr y and the
construction and transport sectors, for gradual
implementation towards 2030. Businesses’ actions to
reduce their CO 2e emissions are generally expected to be
intensified.
In the area of personal customers, a continually
increasing demand for electric cars will reduce the
emission intensity for car loans, while the general
transition of energy supply, including district heating and
electrification, and energy -improving initi atives in
buildings will reduce the emission intensity of home
loans.
It may also be relevant to deal with the adaptation to
physical climate risks in the dialogue with both personal
and business customers.  Targets and actions for investments
Based on 2020, the bank wants to achieve a 50%
reduction of the CO 2e emission intensity per DKK million
invested in asset management and the bank’s own
portfolio by the end of 2030 and to be CO 2e-neutral by the
end of 2050.
The model used to calculate CO 2e emissions from
investments is based on the investments’ current market
value. The value of assets under management
consequently changes with fluctuations in market prices.
The selection criterion for the investment portfolio is that
the bank has direct a ccess to, or can influence, the
composition of the investments. Both issuer -specific and
estimated emission data were used in the calculation.
The data quality is still uncertain since the data coverage
for issuer -specific em issions is not yet 100%. We refer to
Appendix C from  page 111 for additional descriptions of
methodology, assumptions and data quality.
The bank’s total emissions from investments were
calculated at 177,267 tonnes of CO 2e at the end of 2024,
an increase of 40% compared to the end of 2023. The
increase is primarily attributable to shifts in several
investment portfolios, which means that the bank’s CO 2e
intensity increased to 6.72 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK

Question: Les objectifs de réduction fixés sont-ils alignés avec une trajectoire de 1,5°C conformément aux Accords de Paris ? L'entreprise mentionne-t-elle une trajectoire conforme aux objectifs SBTi ? Il convient également de noter que, si l'entreprise affiche des objectifs de neutralité carbone, cette neutralité doit nécessairement être alignée avec les recommandations de l'Accord de Paris.


Context: Pour garantir la compatibilité avec un scénario de transition conforme à l'accord de Paris, l'entreprise doit fournir les informations suivantes : <br><br>- Un/des objectif(s) de réduction avec une trajectoire de réchauffement à 1,5°C grâce à une trajectoire de décarbonation sectorielle si disponible, soit grâce à une trajectoire d'émissions transsectorielle compatible avec la limitation de réchauffement de la planète à 1,5°C (cf. AR 26 et 27). <br><br>- Les facteurs de réduction des émissions évoluent et ne sont pas fixes encore. Par conséquent, les entreprises sont encouragées à n'utiliser que des informations actualisées et publiquement accessibles. L'EFRAG préconise Pathways to Net-Zero - SBTi Technical Summary). Les cibles de réduction doivent être fixées respectivement à 2030 et 2050, avec des échellons tous les 5 ans. 


Answer: Les objectifs de réduction fixés par l'entreprise sont alignés avec les objectifs de l'Accord de Paris, visant à maintenir l'augmentation de la température mondiale bien en dessous de 2°C et à poursuivre les efforts pour limiter l'augmentation à 1,5°C par rapport aux niveaux préindustriels. L'entreprise a défini ces objectifs en soutien à la Loi européenne sur le climat et l'Accord de Paris. Cependant, il n'est pas explicitement mentionné dans le texte que l'entreprise suit une trajectoire conforme aux objectifs Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Pour ce qui est de la neutralité carbone, l'entreprise vise à atteindre cet objectif d'ici 2050, ce qui est en ligne avec les recommandations de l'Accord de Paris.

smaller, and the data quality for CO 2e emissions is also
uncertain.
Internal stakeholders were involved in determining the
reduction targets. The targets are consistent with the EU
climate targets and the Paris Agreement. They have not
been verified by external parties. Given the bank’s size
and sector composition, the ban k judges that it is not
possible to set actual sector -specific targets.  
Projections of the bank’s targets for reduction of CO 2e emissions (index 2020 = 100)  
(1) In 2020, the bank had total emissions of approx. 530,000 tonnes of CO 2e in scope 1, 2 and 3, including a CO 2e intensity of 10.32 tonnes per DKK million lent
and 9.66 tonnes per DKK million invested.
(2) With annual growth of 5% in both financed loans and investments in the period 2025  - 2030 and given the growth realised for 2020 -2024, the total growth in
business volume will contribute emissions of approx. 287,000 tonnes of CO 2e, equivalent to an increase of 54% in 2030 compared to 2020.
(3) The bank’s target of reducing the CO 2e intensity of financed loans by 45% in 2020  - 2030 to 5.68 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK million lent will contribute a
decrease of approx. 189,000 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030, equivalent to -35% based on the 2020 loan portfolio.
(4) Similarly, the bank’s target of reducing the CO 2e intensity of investments by 50% in  2020 -2030 to 4.83 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK million invested will
contribute a decrease of approx. 93,000 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030, equivalent to -18% based on the 2020 investment portfolio.
(5) The target for the bank’s scope 1 and 2 emissions is a reduction to 135 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030.

further 34% in the period 2020  - 2030. Against this
background, the bank’s targets for CO 2e reductions are
consistent with both the European Climate Law and the
Paris Agreement.
In setting the targets, it was essential that the bank can
continue its organic growth strategy and win additional
market share. The quantitative targets set for 2030 are
therefore intensity -based.
For the period until 2030, the bank has implemented and
planned a range of qualitative initiatives in the work
towards the CO 2e targets. They include climate dialogues
with certain customers, ESG scoring of investments, new
ESG tools and product offers.
The bank will evaluate the initiatives on an ongoing basis
and implement any necessary additional initiatives in the
work towards reducing CO 2e emissions, including setting
five-year sub -targets from 2030 until the 2050 target.
In 2024, the bank set the target that CO 2e emissions from
the bank’s own operations (scope 1 and 2) should be
reduced by 60% in the period 2019 -2030. No embedded
CO 2e emissions of significance are judged to exist. The
bank has implemented and planned various initiatives to
reduce emissions from its own operations.
Please see the “Climate change targets and actions”

		 Source:since the gro wth in business volume could be bigger or
smaller, and the data quality for CO 2e emissions is also
uncertain.
Internal stakeholders were involved in determining the
reduction targets. The targets are consistent with the EU
climate targets and the Paris Agreement. They have not
been verified by external parties. Given the bank’s size
and sector composition, the ban k judges that it is not
possible to set actual sector -specific targets.  
Projections of the bank’s targets for reduction of CO 2e emissions (index 2020 = 100)  
(1) In 2020, the bank had total emissions of approx. 530,000 tonnes of CO 2e in scope 1, 2 and 3, including a CO 2e intensity of 10.32 tonnes per DKK million lent
and 9.66 tonnes per DKK million invested.
(2) With annual growth of 5% in both financed loans and investments in the period 2025  - 2030 and given the growth realised for 2020 -2024, the total growth in
business volume will contribute emissions of approx. 287,000 tonnes of CO 2e, equivalent to an increase of 54% in 2030 compared to 2020.
(3) The bank’s target of reducing the CO 2e intensity of financed loans by 45% in 2020  - 2030 to 5.68 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK million lent will contribute a
decrease of approx. 189,000 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030, equivalent to -35% based on the 2020 loan portfolio.
(4) Similarly, the bank’s target of reducing the CO 2e intensity of investments by 50% in  2020 -2030 to 4.83 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK million invested will
contribute a decrease of approx. 93,000 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030, equivalent to -18% based on the 2020 investment portfolio.
(5) The target for the bank’s scope 1 and 2 emissions is a reduction to 135 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030.

Transition plan
(E1-1)
The corporate social responsibility and sustainability
policy is implemented via a separate transition plan for
climate and the environment approved by the bank’s
board of directors and published on the bank’s website.
The transition plan describes the bank’s targets and
initiatives for reducing CO 2e emissions towards 2030 and
for achieving climate neutrality by 2050.
The indirect CO 2e emissions from loans and investments
(scope 3) account for almost all of the bank’s total CO 2e
emissions and are therefore focus areas in the transition
plan. In 2023, the bank set the sub -targets of reducing
CO 2e emissions by 45% per DKK million lent and by 50%
per DKK million invested in the period 2020  - 2030.

____________________

		 Source:For example, agreements have been entered into on
carbon taxes on emissions in industr y and the
construction and transport sectors, for gradual
implementation towards 2030. Businesses’ actions to
reduce their CO 2e emissions are generally expected to be
intensified.
In the area of personal customers, a continually
increasing demand for electric cars will reduce the
emission intensity for car loans, while the general
transition of energy supply, including district heating and
electrification, and energy -improving initi atives in
buildings will reduce the emission intensity of home
loans.
It may also be relevant to deal with the adaptation to
physical climate risks in the dialogue with both personal
and business customers.  Targets and actions for investments
Based on 2020, the bank wants to achieve a 50%
reduction of the CO 2e emission intensity per DKK million
invested in asset management and the bank’s own
portfolio by the end of 2030 and to be CO 2e-neutral by the
end of 2050.
The model used to calculate CO 2e emissions from
investments is based on the investments’ current market
value. The value of assets under management
consequently changes with fluctuations in market prices.
The selection criterion for the investment portfolio is that
the bank has direct a ccess to, or can influence, the
composition of the investments. Both issuer -specific and
estimated emission data were used in the calculation.
The data quality is still uncertain since the data coverage
for issuer -specific em issions is not yet 100%. We refer to
Appendix C from  page 111 for additional descriptions of
methodology, assumptions and data quality.
The bank’s total emissions from investments were
calculated at 177,267 tonnes of CO 2e at the end of 2024,
an increase of 40% compared to the end of 2023. The
increase is primarily attributable to shifts in several
investment portfolios, which means that the bank’s CO 2e
intensity increased to 6.72 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK

The bank’s general management is generally responsible
for fulfilling the policy and taking action if the policy is not
complied with. On the recommendation of the general
management, it is the responsibility of the bank’s board
of directors that the polic y is reviewed and possibly

Donations to the local community
The bank’s corporate social responsibility and
sustainability policy describes how the bank intends to
support local communities.
Although the bank now has activities throughout
Denmark - mainly in West, Central and North Jutland - the
bank remains a local bank with strong roots in the local
communities where the bank is physically present under
the two brands.
The bank will therefore use its comprehensive knowledge
of the area’s residents and businesses by offering
responsible credit and competent, honest advice, which
benefits both the customers and the local communities.
Focusing on its intention to be an integral part of the local
communities, the bank is committed to playing an active
role in the development of local businesses. This
commitment extends to cultural and social purposes. The
bank thus supports local sportin g and cultural life in the
areas we serve, because both sporting and cultural
experiences create solidarity and contribute to a healthy
and interesting life.
Through its operating activities and support the bank
contributes to almost 900 local events, sports clubs and
cultural associations. The bank has not determined
quantitative targets for the size of donations , but major
amounts are distributed annually. The bank also
encourages its employees to participate, preferably
actively, in community clubs, associations and cultural
life.

Question: Quelles sont les mesures prises pour remédier au non-respect des procédures et des normes en matière de lutte contre la corruption? Pour répondre à cette question, s'intéresser aux mesures de détection, aux mesures de remédiation et à l'engagement continu en matière de lutte anti-corruption.


Context: 24(b) Toute mesure prise pour remédier au non-respect des procédures et des normes en matière de lutte contre la corruption.


Answer: Pour remédier au non-respect des procédures et des normes en matière de lutte contre la corruption, Ringkøbing Landbobank A/S a mis en place plusieurs mesures :

1. **Mesures de détection** :
   - Les incidents de corruption et de pot-de-vin doivent être signalés immédiatement au supérieur hiérarchique, au département des ressources humaines de la banque, et au département de gestion des risques opérationnels et de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent.
   - Les employés peuvent également signaler les incidents via le système interne de dénonciation de la banque.

2. **Mesures de remédiation** :
   - La personne responsable de l'examen et du traitement des incidents potentiels de corruption ou de pot-de-vin, souvent le chef du département des ressources humaines ou une personne autorisée par le système de dénonciation, doit examiner immédiatement l'incident de manière indépendante des parties impliquées.
   - Si un conflit d'intérêts existe, des actions d'atténuation seront prises.
   - Les violations importantes doivent être signalées directement à la direction générale, sauf si cela implique un membre de la direction générale, auquel cas c'est au président du conseil d'administration que le problème doit être signalé.

3. **Engagement continu en matière de lutte anti-corruption** :
   - La banque a une politique de tolérance zéro envers la corruption et s'efforce de la combattre sous toutes ses formes.
   - Tous les employés doivent lire annuellement le code de conduite et confirmer qu'ils le comprennent, et les nouveaux employés reçoivent ce code pour révision lors de leur intégration.
   - Le conseil d'administration de la banque est informé de tout incident de violation des dispositions anti-corruption et anti-pot-de-vin et des conséquences de ces violations.
   - La politique anti-corruption et anti-pot-de-vin de la banque est accessible sur l'intranet et le site Web de la banque, permettant ainsi aux parties externes d'en prendre connaissance.

Ces mesures démontrent un engagement fort de la part de la banque pour prévenir et remédier aux cas de corruption, tout en assurant une formation continue et une transparence des politiques en place.

corruption or bribery. The person must immediately
examine the incident independently of the involved
parties. Mitigating actions will be taken if a conflict of
interests exists.
Material violations and related matters must always be
reported directly to the general management unless the
matter involves a general management member, in which
case the matter must be reported directly to the chair of
the board of directors. The bank c ontinually supervises
the bank’s compliance with the current anti -corruption
and anti -bribery rules. All suspicions of violations of
applicable law will be reported to the relevant authorities.
The board of directors will be informed of any incidents
of violation of the anti -corruption and anti -bribery
provisions and the consequences of such violations.
The bank has no recorded cases, convictions and/or
fines for violation of anti -corruption and anti -bribery
legislation in 2024.  
Training
The bank’s guidelines for preventing and combating
corruption and bribery and the consequences of violation
are described in the bank’s code of conduct and
employee handbook, which are available to all employees
via the bank’s intranet. The code of conduct and the
employee handbook thus define the boundaries to non -
acceptable conduct.
The bank assesses that customer -facing employees,
employees who make purchases and employees in
certain staff functions are particularly exposed to the risk
of corruption and bribery.
To ensure that the employees are updated and trained in
the area, all employees must read the code of conduct
annually and reaffirm that they understand it. New
employees receive the code of conduct for review as part
of their onboarding and must also read  the employee
handbook. The bank thus endeavours to keep the
employees fully up to date through a training programme
which requires them to read and understand the code of
conduct. The bank also annually requests criminal record

Anti-corruption and bribery policy
The bank’s anti -corruption and anti -bribery policy sets out
the general guidelines and procedures for how the bank
should work to prevent and combat corruption and
bribery. The bank has zero tolerance for, and endeavours
to combat, corruption and bribery in all their forms.
In accordance with the concept of corruption referred to
in the Danish Penal Code and the international anti -
corruption conventions, including the UN Convention
against Corruption, corruption is defined as the abuse of
entrusted power for private gain. Cor ruption, possibly
deriving from a conflict of interests, takes many forms
including bribery, extortion and/or private treaty, which
induce someone to act illegally or in breach of their
duties.
The bank and its employees may neither accept nor offer
any bribes, and gifts must not be accepted if they exceed
token value. The bank’s anti -corruption and anti -bribery
policy applies to and must be observed by all employees
in the bank. Employees violat ing applicable law and/or
the bank’s internal guidelines may be prosecuted, and
legal consequences may be imposed on them under
employment law.

Question: Quelles sont les émissions totales du Scope 2, calculées grâce à la méthode "location-based" ?


Context: nan


Answer: Les émissions totales du Scope 2, calculées grâce à la méthode "location-based", sont de 404 tonnes de CO2e en 2024.


Sources:


		 Source:Scope 2 emissions in the location -based statement were
404 tonnes of CO 2e in 2024.
Scope 3 emissions
Total indirect emissions from the bank’s activities (scope
3) are calculated at 545,142 tonnes of CO 2e in 2024. In
the GHG Protocol, this covers emissions in category 6
(business travel) and category 15 (investments).
Category 15 emissions were 545,062 tonnes of CO 2e in
2024, an increase of 24,248 tonnes compared to 2023.
The category comprises the bank’s CO 2e emissions from
financed loans, asset management investments, the
bank’s own portfolio investments and IT operation.
As appears from the “Climate change targets and
actions” section from page 68, the increase in 2024 is primarily attributable to shifts in investment portfolios
which resulted in a higher CO 2e emission intensity for
investments. Emissions from investments thus increased
by 50,229 tonnes of CO 2e from 2023 to 2024, whereas
emissions from financed loans decreased by 26,105
tonnes.
The bank’s IT operations and IT development are
outsourced to Bankdata, which in turn has outsourced the
energy -hungry IT operations to JN Data. Emissions from
IT operations totalled 1,042 tonnes of CO 2e for 2024, an
increase of 124 tonnes compared to 2023. With effect
from the beginning of 2023, electricity consumption has
been based on renewable energy sources because
Bankdata and JN Data have entered into a long -term
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), wh ich led to the
construction of a solar energy park.
Emissions from the bank’s business travel totalled 80
tonnes of CO 2e in 2024. Business travel comprises work -
related travel in the employees’ own cars and purchased
transportation by taxi, train, ferry and aircraft. Emissions
from business travel decreased by 15 tonnes of CO 2e
compared to 2023, particularly due to fewer kilometres
travelled and an increasing share of electric cars for
employee travel.
Business travel and IT operation are included in the
bank’s CO 2e statement for the first time in 2024.

Ringkjøbing Landbobank has calculated its total CO 2e
emissions at 545,348 million tonnes for 2024, compared
to 521,100 million tonnes for 2023 using the market -

to 134 tonnes in 2024. The bank’s core income increased
by 87% in the same period.
As stated in the “ Additional information regarding the

Scope 1 emissions
In 2024, the bank’s scope 1 emissions increased by
tonnes to 70 tonnes of CO 2e. The main reason for the
increase is an increase in the number of company cars.
Travel in the bank’s company cars accounted for 82% of
scope 1 emissions in 2024, while the remaining 18% were
generated by heating production from natural gas which
is part of the local supply to a few of the bank’s branches.
Scope 2 emissions
Scope 2 emissions in the market -based statement derive
exclusively from the district heating consumption in the
bank’s buildings, see the “Energy consumption” section
from page 75.
The bank’s district heating consumption decreased by
183 MWh from 2023 to 2024. At the same time the share
of renewable energy in district heating production
increased at national level. Scope 2 emissions
nevertheless increased by 6 tonnes of CO 2e to 136
tonnes in 2024 in the market -based statement. The
increase is caused by higher emission intensity in the part
of the district heating production based on fossil fuels.
Scope 2 emissions in the location -based statement were
404 tonnes of CO 2e in 2024.
Scope 3 emissions
Total indirect emissions from the bank’s activities (scope

		 Source:For example, agreements have been entered into on
carbon taxes on emissions in industr y and the
construction and transport sectors, for gradual
implementation towards 2030. Businesses’ actions to
reduce their CO 2e emissions are generally expected to be
intensified.
In the area of personal customers, a continually
increasing demand for electric cars will reduce the
emission intensity for car loans, while the general
transition of energy supply, including district heating and
electrification, and energy -improving initi atives in
buildings will reduce the emission intensity of home
loans.
It may also be relevant to deal with the adaptation to
physical climate risks in the dialogue with both personal
and business customers.  Targets and actions for investments
Based on 2020, the bank wants to achieve a 50%
reduction of the CO 2e emission intensity per DKK million
invested in asset management and the bank’s own
portfolio by the end of 2030 and to be CO 2e-neutral by the
end of 2050.
The model used to calculate CO 2e emissions from
investments is based on the investments’ current market
value. The value of assets under management
consequently changes with fluctuations in market prices.
The selection criterion for the investment portfolio is that
the bank has direct a ccess to, or can influence, the
composition of the investments. Both issuer -specific and
estimated emission data were used in the calculation.
The data quality is still uncertain since the data coverage
for issuer -specific em issions is not yet 100%. We refer to
Appendix C from  page 111 for additional descriptions of
methodology, assumptions and data quality.
The bank’s total emissions from investments were
calculated at 177,267 tonnes of CO 2e at the end of 2024,
an increase of 40% compared to the end of 2023. The
increase is primarily attributable to shifts in several
investment portfolios, which means that the bank’s CO 2e
intensity increased to 6.72 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK

Context: nan


Answer: Les objectifs de réduction du plan de transition de la banque se décomposent comme suit :

1. **Valeurs brutes de réduction des GES, séparées par Scope :**
   - **Scope 1 et 2 :** La banque vise une réduction à 135 tonnes de CO2e d'ici 2030. L'objectif pour 2024 est une réduction de 60 % par rapport à 2019.
   - **Scope 3 :** 
     - Pour les prêts financés, une réduction de 189,000 tonnes de CO2e est prévue d'ici 2030.
     - Pour les investissements, une réduction de 93,000 tonnes de CO2e est prévue d'ici 2030.

2. **Cibles de réduction des GES en pourcentage par rapport à une année de référence :**
   - **Scope 1 et 2 :** Réduction de 60 % entre 2019 et 2030.
   - **Scope 3 :** 
     - Réduction de l'intensité des émissions de CO2e des prêts financés de 45 % entre 2020 et 2030.
     - Réduction de l'intensité des émissions de CO2e des investissements de 50 % entre 2020 et 2030.

3. **Cibles de réduction en intensité monétaire, séparées par Scope :**
   - **Scope 3 :** 
     - Pour les prêts financés, réduction de l'intensité à 5.68 tonnes de CO2e par DKK million prêté d'ici 2030.
     - Pour les investissements, réduction de l'intensité à 4.83 tonnes de CO2e par DKK million investi d'ici 2030.

4. **Détails supplémentaires :**
   - Les objectifs concernent principalement les émissions financées, relevant du Scope 3.
   - La méthodologie utilisée pour fixer les objectifs inclut des principes communs développés par le secteur financier au Danemark, avec une prise en compte des réductions déjà réalisées au niveau sociétal.
   - Les objectifs sont alignés avec les cibles climatiques de l'UE et l'Accord de Paris.
   - Les années de référence et cibles sont 2020 et 2030 respectivement, pour la majorité des objectifs.

En résumé, la banque a fixé des objectifs ambitieux pour réduire ses émissions de GES, en se concentrant principalement sur les émissions de Scope 3 associées aux prêts et investissements, tout en cherchant à aligner ses efforts avec les engagements climatiques internationaux.

		 Source:since the gro wth in business volume could be bigger or
smaller, and the data quality for CO 2e emissions is also
uncertain.
Internal stakeholders were involved in determining the
reduction targets. The targets are consistent with the EU
climate targets and the Paris Agreement. They have not
been verified by external parties. Given the bank’s size
and sector composition, the ban k judges that it is not
possible to set actual sector -specific targets.  
Projections of the bank’s targets for reduction of CO 2e emissions (index 2020 = 100)  
(1) In 2020, the bank had total emissions of approx. 530,000 tonnes of CO 2e in scope 1, 2 and 3, including a CO 2e intensity of 10.32 tonnes per DKK million lent
and 9.66 tonnes per DKK million invested.
(2) With annual growth of 5% in both financed loans and investments in the period 2025  - 2030 and given the growth realised for 2020 -2024, the total growth in
business volume will contribute emissions of approx. 287,000 tonnes of CO 2e, equivalent to an increase of 54% in 2030 compared to 2020.
(3) The bank’s target of reducing the CO 2e intensity of financed loans by 45% in 2020  - 2030 to 5.68 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK million lent will contribute a
decrease of approx. 189,000 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030, equivalent to -35% based on the 2020 loan portfolio.
(4) Similarly, the bank’s target of reducing the CO 2e intensity of investments by 50% in  2020 -2030 to 4.83 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK million invested will
contribute a decrease of approx. 93,000 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030, equivalent to -18% based on the 2020 investment portfolio.
(5) The target for the bank’s scope 1 and 2 emissions is a reduction to 135 tonnes of CO 2e in 2030.

____________________

		 Source:The transition plan describes the bank’s targets and
initiatives for reducing CO 2e emissions towards 2030 and
for achieving climate neutrality by 2050.
The indirect CO 2e emissions from loans and investments
(scope 3) account for almost all of the bank’s total CO 2e
emissions and are therefore focus areas in the transition
plan. In 2023, the bank set the sub -targets of reducing
CO 2e emissions by 45% per DKK million lent and by 50%
per DKK million invested in the period 2020  - 2030.
These targets took into account reductions already
achieved at society level. At EU level, CO 2e emissions
were reduced by 32% in the period 1990 -2020. To achieve
a   % reduction by 2030, which is the EU’s target,
emissions in the EU must therefore be reduced by a
further 34% in the period 2020  - 2030. Against this
background, the bank’s targets for CO 2e reductions are
consistent with both the European Climate Law and the
Paris Agreement.
In setting the targets, it was essential that the bank can
continue its organic growth strategy and win additional
market share. The quantitative targets set for 2030 are
therefore intensity -based.
For the period until 2030, the bank has implemented and
planned a range of qualitative initiatives in the work
towards the CO 2e targets. They include climate dialogues
with certain customers, ESG scoring of investments, new
ESG tools and product offers.
The bank will evaluate the initiatives on an ongoing basis
and implement any necessary additional initiatives in the
work towards reducing CO 2e emissions, including setting
five-year sub -targets from 2030 until the 2050 target.
In 2024, the bank set the target that CO 2e emissions from
the bank’s own operations (scope 1 and 2) should be
reduced by 60% in the period 2019 -2030. No embedded
CO 2e emissions of significance are judged to exist. The
bank has implemented and planned various initiatives to
reduce emissions from its own operations.

(1) Figures in the table were rounded. The statement follows the reporting standards in paragraphs 62  - 67 of ESRS 1, see the fact box in Appendix C from page
111, and industry standards in Denmark, see Appendix A from page 102. There was no review of 2023.
(2) Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2024 cover the period from the fourth quarter of 2023 up to and including the third quarter o f 2024, which is estimated to be
representative of full -year 2024. The target for scope 1 and 2 reflects the goal of 60% reduction by 2030 using the market -based method with 2019 as a base year.
The location -based method was used for the first time for 2024. The bank has not set a sub -target for 2025.
(3) Scope 3 emissions from business travel and outsourced IT operation were stated for the first time for 2023, see the descr iption in Appendix C. Emissions from
IT operation for 2024 are based on 2023 figures from Bankdata and JN Data, which is estimated to be representative of full -year 2024. The targets for financed
loans and the investment portfolio reflect the bank’s 2030 goal of reducing CO 2e intensity from them by 45% and 50% respectively with 2020 as a base year. The
bank has not set a sub -target fo r 2025 or targets for the other scope 3 categories.
(4) Projection based on an assumed annual growth of 5% in loans in the period 2025  - 2030. CO 2e emissions from loans can increase towards 2030 since the bank
uses an intensity target. This is calculated with the realised growth in loans in 2020  - 2024.
(5) CO 2e emissions from loans can increase in absolute figures towards 2030 since the bank uses an intensity target and assumes annu al growth in loans.
(6) Projection based on an assumed annual growth of 5% in investments in the period 2025  - 2030. CO 2e emissions from investments may increase towards 2030

Targets and actions for financed loans
With 2020 as the base year, the bank wants to reduce the
CO 2e emission intensity from its loan portfolio by 45% per
DKK million lent by the end of 2030. The bank wants to be
CO 2e-neutral by the end of 2050.
To calculate CO 2e emissions from loans, the bank uses
the common principles and methods developed by the
financial sector in Denmark. For personal customers, on -
balance sheet loans for housing purposes and car
purchases are included in the calculation. Loans for
which a p urpose cannot be determined are not included.
For business customers, total loans broken down by
industry are included. The computation is widely based
on average calculations and therefore highly uncertain.
The data quality will improve as  company -specific data
can be obtained. We refer to Appendix C from page 111
for a description of methodol ogy, assumptions and data
quality.
In 2024, emissions from the bank’s total loans to
personal and business customers decreased by 7% to
366,753 tonnes of CO 2e. This is equivalent to intensity of 7.09 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK million lent at the end of
2024 compared to 8.34 tonnes at the end of 2023.
The main reason for the decrease in 2024 was that lower
emissions were recorded in several industries in the
business communities despite the growth in loans for the
year. Loans to business and agricultural customers
accounted for  4% of the bank’s total e missions from
loans in 2024, with an average CO 2e intensity of 8.79
tonnes per DKK million lent. Loans to agriculture
contributed intensity of 26.79 tonnes of CO 2e per DKK
million lent, while the average intensity for business
excluding agriculture was 6.1 3 tonnes of CO 2e.
For personal customers, emissions at the end of 2024
were calculated at 21,548 tonnes of CO 2e, equivalent to

Data quality of the CO 2e calculation for loans
To calculate CO 2e emissions, the bank has used the
common principles and methods developed under the
auspices of Finance Denmark (CO 2 model for the
financial sector) for measurement and calculation of
financed emissions from loans (before impairment
charges).
It is not possible to calculate CO 2e emissions for the
entire loan portfolio for personal customers because
loans to personal customers often have no specific
purpose. An example of this is overdraft facilities. The
specific purposes of loans are most often homes and
cars. In accordance wit h the CO 2 model, only emissions
financed from home and car loans are therefore included
for personal customers. Only emissions from loans on
the bank’s own balance sheet are stated. Arranged
mortgage credit loans are thus not included in the
statement.
CO 2e emissions from home loans are a calculated
average based on the average CO 2e emission per DKK
million lent. The bank is working with data providers to
calculate the future CO 2e emissions from home loans
based on the individual building’s energy rating or an
estimated rating based on the building’s energy source,
age, size and location.
CO 2e emissions from car loans are stated using emission
data calculated by the Danish Centre for Environment and
Energy (DCE) at Aarhus University. A calculated average

____________________

		 Source:Scope 2 emissions in the location -based statement were
404 tonnes of CO 2e in 2024.
Scope 3 emissions
Total indirect emissions from the bank’s activities (scope
3) are calculated at 545,142 tonnes of CO 2e in 2024. In
the GHG Protocol, this covers emissions in category 6
(business travel) and category 15 (investments).
Category 15 emissions were 545,062 tonnes of CO 2e in
2024, an increase of 24,248 tonnes compared to 2023.
The category comprises the bank’s CO 2e emissions from
financed loans, asset management investments, the
bank’s own portfolio investments and IT operation.
As appears from the “Climate change targets and
actions” section from page 68, the increase in 2024 is primarily attributable to shifts in investment portfolios
which resulted in a higher CO 2e emission intensity for
investments. Emissions from investments thus increased
by 50,229 tonnes of CO 2e from 2023 to 2024, whereas
emissions from financed loans decreased by 26,105
tonnes.
The bank’s IT operations and IT development are
outsourced to Bankdata, which in turn has outsourced the
energy -hungry IT operations to JN Data. Emissions from
IT operations totalled 1,042 tonnes of CO 2e for 2024, an
increase of 124 tonnes compared to 2023. With effect
from the beginning of 2023, electricity consumption has
been based on renewable energy sources because
Bankdata and JN Data have entered into a long -term
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), wh ich led to the
construction of a solar energy park.
Emissions from the bank’s business travel totalled 80
tonnes of CO 2e in 2024. Business travel comprises work -
related travel in the employees’ own cars and purchased
transportation by taxi, train, ferry and aircraft. Emissions
from business travel decreased by 15 tonnes of CO 2e
compared to 2023, particularly due to fewer kilometres
travelled and an increasing share of electric cars for
employee travel.
Business travel and IT operation are included in the
bank’s CO 2e statement for the first time in 2024.

Scope 2  Energy -related indirect CO 2e emissions
Reported based on the GHG Protocol and comprise all indirect emissions resulting from the energy used to
produce electricity, district heating and district cooling, which the bank has purchased for its use from a third
party.  
Location -based emissions are based on the average emission intensity of energy sources where the energy is
used.  
Market -based emissions are calculated using the location -based emissions from which purchases of energy
generated from renewable energy sources are subtracted.

Question: L'entreprise est-elle concernée par les critères d'exclusion des indices de référence de l'Accord de Paris ? Pour répondre à cette question, il convient de déterminer si l'entreprise possède l'une des caractéristiques suivantes: <br><br> Elle participe à la production ou à la commercialisation d'armes controversées <br> Elle est impliquée dans la culture ou la production de tabac <br> Elle ne respecte pas les principes directeurs de l'OCDE ou viole les principes du Pacte mondial des Nations Unies. <br> Elle tire au moins 1% de son chiffre d'affaires des énergies fossiles. <br><br> Si l'une de ces caractéristiques est avérée, l'entreprise est concernée par les critères d'exclusion. En revanche, si aucune information n'est disponible concernant ces caractéristiques, cela signifie que l'entreprise n'est pas concernée par les critères d'exclusion de l'indice de référence de l'Accord de Paris.


Context: nan


Answer: L'entreprise est concernée par les critères d'exclusion des indices de référence de l'Accord de Paris si elle remplit l'une des conditions suivantes :

1. Elle participe à la production ou à la commercialisation d'armes controversées.
2. Elle est impliquée dans la culture ou la production de tabac.
3. Elle ne respecte pas les principes directeurs de l'OCDE ou viole les principes du Pacte mondial des Nations Unies.
4. Elle tire au moins 1% de son chiffre d'affaires des énergies fossiles.

Selon les informations fournies :

- L'entreprise est impliquée dans des activités liées à la production d'armes controversées (ESRS 2 SBM -1 40 (d) iii)), ce qui est considéré comme matériel.
- Elle est également impliquée dans des activités liées à la culture et la production de tabac (ESRS 2 SBM -1 40 (d) iv)), ce qui est matériel.
- Elle est impliquée dans des activités liées aux énergies fossiles (ESRS 2 SBM -1 40 (d) i)), ce qui est matériel.

Ainsi, l'entreprise remplit plusieurs des critères énoncés et est donc concernée par les critères d'exclusion des indices de référence de l'Accord de Paris.

Question: Décrivez la manière dont le plan de transition pour l'atténuation des risques climatiques est intégré dans la stratégie commerciale globale la planification financière de l'entreprise.


Context: nan


Answer: Le plan de transition pour l'atténuation des risques climatiques est intégré dans la stratégie commerciale globale et la planification financière de l'entreprise à travers plusieurs initiatives et objectifs. Le plan s'appuie sur la politique de responsabilité sociale de l'entreprise et de durabilité, et il est approuvé par le conseil d'administration de la banque. 

L'objectif fondamental de ce plan est de réduire les émissions de CO2e afin de contribuer à l'atténuation du changement climatique. Cela est en harmonie avec la loi européenne sur le climat et l'Accord de Paris, qui visent à limiter la hausse de la température mondiale. Pour ce faire, la banque a mis en place des cibles spécifiques, telles que la réduction des émissions de CO2e de 45% par DKK million prêté et de 50% par DKK million investi entre 2020 et 2030. 

Afin de soutenir ces objectifs, la banque a développé des initiatives qualitatives telles que des dialogues climatiques avec certains clients, l'évaluation ESG des investissements, ainsi que l'utilisation de nouveaux outils et offres de produits ESG. Ces initiatives sont intégrées dans la stratégie commerciale pour encourager une croissance organique tout en augmentant la part de marché de la banque. 

La banque met également l'accent sur le financement d'actifs durables comme les énergies renouvelables et l'amélioration de l'efficacité énergétique, ce qui est perçu comme une opportunité commerciale importante. Elle continue d'évaluer et d'ajuster ces initiatives pour s'assurer qu'elles restent alignées sur ses objectifs climatiques et financiers. En résumé, le plan de transition est un élément clé de la stratégie commerciale globale, visant à concilier croissance économique et responsabilité environnementale.

done for all of the bank’s main  industries for loans. The
bank’s credit department validated the review.
The identified climate -related risks are shown in the table
in the “Climate -related impacts, risks and opportunities”
section from page 66. The bank has not identified
material risks of a physical nature. On the other hand , the
bank judges that certain climate -related transition risks
and opportunities are inherent in its business model.
The bank generally views agriculture as the most
transition -exposed industry in the loan portfolio at
present. Thus, loans to agriculture in particular account
for a sizeable part of the bank’s financed emissions, and considerable efforts in within agriculture are judged to be
required to achieve climate -neutral economy for this part
of the loan portfolio. The bank’s financing of transport
assets also requires a considerable effort to achieve
climate neutrality.
The bank has initially quantified this risk and allocated
management estimates for impairment charges to take
account of the current uncertainty about the framework
conditions announced under the Green Tripartite
Agreement.
Climate change policies
(E1-2)
The bank’s work on climate -related impacts, risks and
opportunities originates in its corporate social
responsibility and sustainability policy and the transition
plan.
The fundamental objective is to mitigate climate change
by reducing CO 2e emissions. Important elements in this
are to improve energy efficiency, increase renewable
energy deployment and support new technologies, in the
bank’s own operations as well as the value chain.
For the loan portfolio, the bank primarily implements
environment and climate -related initiatives through its
credit policy. The bank does so in relation to CO 2e
reductions and the adaptation to physical risks in
connection with credit assessment and valuations.

Transition plan
(E1-1)
The corporate social responsibility and sustainability
policy is implemented via a separate transition plan for
climate and the environment approved by the bank’s
board of directors and published on the bank’s website.
The transition plan describes the bank’s targets and
initiatives for reducing CO 2e emissions towards 2030 and
for achieving climate neutrality by 2050.
The indirect CO 2e emissions from loans and investments
(scope 3) account for almost all of the bank’s total CO 2e
emissions and are therefore focus areas in the transition
plan. In 2023, the bank set the sub -targets of reducing
CO 2e emissions by 45% per DKK million lent and by 50%
per DKK million invested in the period 2020  - 2030.

____________________

		 Source:work towards reducing CO 2e emissions, including setting
five-year sub -targets from 2030 until the 2050 target.
In 2024, the bank set the target that CO 2e emissions from
the bank’s own operations (scope 1 and 2) should be
reduced by 60% in the period 2019 -2030. No embedded
CO 2e emissions of significance are judged to exist. The
bank has implemented and planned various initiatives to
reduce emissions from its own operations.
Please see the “Climate change targets and actions”
section from page 68 for  further details on the bank’s
climate -related targets, actions and initiatives and
reporting on the bank’s progress on the targets.  Climate -related impacts, risks and
opportunities
(E1.SBM -3)
The bank’s strategy and business model are built around
a strong customer focus, sound credit principles and
efficient business processes. The business model is
fundamentally robust in relation to climate change and is
generally judged to be resilient in different climate
scenarios.
The bank’s physical operations are relatively modest. The
bank’s own operations and activities in the upstream
value chain are generally judged to hold relatively limited
risks and opportunities. See the following table of
material impacts, risks and oppor tunities.
The bank is able to transition its business on an ongoing
basis and with a short time horizon if climate -related
conditions call for financing of other types of assets. The
business is, however, exposed to certain climate -related
risks, primarily in the bank’s lending business in the
downstream value chain.
As stated in the “Transition plan” section on page 66, the
bank has set its climate targets in support of the
European Climate Law and the aim of the Paris
Agreement to keep the global temperature rise below 2
degrees and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5
degrees above pre -industrial level. The b ank’s analysis of
risks was carried out in accordance with the above

bank has set its climate targets in support of the
European Climate Law and the aim of the Paris
Agreement to keep the global temperature rise below 2
degrees and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5
degrees above pre -industrial level. The b ank’s analysis of
risks was carried out in accordance with the above
climate scenario  even though  the link between the
climate scenario and the effect on the bank’s lending
business has not yet been qua ntified, due to lack of CO 2e
emission data for the bank’s borrowers.  The bank also
follows financial sector analyses.
The time horizon and rate of change are decisive for the
risks facing the bank. A large part of the bank’s loans will
thus have been repaid over a 10 -year horizon and the
bank is generally judged to be robust to changes
occurring gradually over a period of 10 years or more.
The changes in the physical climate are therefore not
judged to pose any major risk per se. Climate change can
reach the financial system faster, howeve r. The value of
assets, e.g. real property, may thus decrease due to
future expectations, and regulatory change can affect the
values of security provided.

CO 2e emissions by 45% per DKK million lent and by 50%
per DKK million invested in the period 2020  - 2030.
These targets took into account reductions already
achieved at society level. At EU level, CO 2e emissions
were reduced by 32% in the period 1990 -2020. To achieve
a   % reduction by 2030, which is the EU’s target,
emissions in the EU must therefore be reduced by a
further 34% in the period 2020  - 2030. Against this
background, the bank’s targets for CO 2e reductions are
consistent with both the European Climate Law and the
Paris Agreement.
In setting the targets, it was essential that the bank can
continue its organic growth strategy and win additional
market share. The quantitative targets set for 2030 are
therefore intensity -based.
For the period until 2030, the bank has implemented and
planned a range of qualitative initiatives in the work
towards the CO 2e targets. They include climate dialogues
with certain customers, ESG scoring of investments, new
ESG tools and product offers.
The bank will evaluate the initiatives on an ongoing basis
and implement any necessary additional initiatives in the
work towards reducing CO 2e emissions, including setting
five-year sub -targets from 2030 until the 2050 target.
In 2024, the bank set the target that CO 2e emissions from
the bank’s own operations (scope 1 and 2) should be
reduced by 60% in the period 2019 -2030. No embedded

distribution has been achieved.
Other management levels
Under the statutory definition of “other management
levels”, the bank’s other management levels are members
of the general management (reported to the Danish
Business Authority), employees placed at the same
management level, in organisational terms, as th e general
management, and employees with staff responsibilities
reporting directly to the general management or to
employees placed at the same level, in organisational

It is a goal of the policy that the bank’s employees should
feel that equal career and management opportunities are
open to them, irrespective of gender. The policy adopted
to increase the percentage of the under -represented
gender at the bank’s other mana gement levels also aims
at creating a basis for a more equal gender distribution at
these management levels. It is the bank’s overall and

at the bank’s other management levels. The bank’s
management wants to follow up on developments with
respect to gender distribution at other management levels and to adjust the effort continually in relation to the

In 2022, the board of directors and its nomination
committee set a target figure of at least 25% for the
under -represented gender at the bank’s other
management levels to be met by 2025.
When updating the policy and target figure for other
management levels in 2024, the board of directors and its
nomination committee assessed that there was no need
for changes in relation to other management levels.
During 2023, the bank implemented various initiatives
aimed at meeting the target figure by 2025. They
comprise recruitment initiatives and initiatives aimed at
motivating employees of the under -represented gender to
pursue different managerial roles, thus  becoming eligible
candidates for the bank’s other management levels. The
initiatives were used and followed up in 2024, and work
on developing and structuring additional initiatives
continued.
The implemented initiatives have improved the key figure
for the under -represented gender from 22.9% at the end
of 2023 to 25.4% at the end of 2024.
The bank thus met the 25% target at the end of 2024.
Against this background and in accordance with the

In 2024, the employee turnover rate was 10.5% including
retirees, which means that the employees stay with the
bank for over 10 years on average.
This indicates a high level of wellbeing and job
satisfaction. A total of 69.7 employees (FTEs) retired or
left the bank in 2024.
The increase in absence due to sickness is attributable to
an increase in long -term sickness absences unrelated to
work, compared to 2023. Work -related absence due to
sickness actually decreased compared to the year before.
Whether their absence is work -related or otherwise, the
bank’s offers and structure support absent employees in
making a good return to their workplace.

Employee security and wellbeing are also supported by
the bank’s health policy and a stress management and
alleviation plan which offer the employees various forms
of support as preventive measures and in the event of
actual health -related challenges. Supp ort includes health
insurance, seniors schemes, business psychologist and
online doctor etc.
In addition, the bank seeks to continue to launch the
initiatives described in the “Initiatives for engaging with
own workforce” section from page 84. These initiatives
give the bank insight into employee wellbeing and their
view of the bank as a workplace. The initiatives also
enable the bank to assess whether to take additional
action to accommodate employee needs and ensure
employee satisfaction. In addition, the initiatives help to
prevent the bank from causing or contributing to material
negative impacts on its own workforce.
In 2024, the bank allocated resources to the annual
measurement of “Collaboration and Wellbeing” among all
employees, the annual job appraisal interviews etc.
Characteristics of the workforce
(S1-6, S1 -8, S1 -10, S1 -13, S1 -16 and S1 -17)
The bank employed an average of 664.4 FTEs in 2024.
Compared to the year before, this is an increase of 11.8
FTEs, which is caused both by the bank’s general growth
and an increased need for special skills. The percentage
of the under -represented gender ba sed on FTEs was

Workforce -related impacts, risks and
opportunities
(S1.SBM -3 and S1 -7)
Ringkjøbing Landbobank places great emphasis on its
employees’ working conditions, including health and
wellbeing, and seeks to ensure diversity and equal
opportunity for all irrespective of gender etc. Training and
development of employee skills are also given high
priority. As a knowledge workplace the bank considers
these factors essential for attracting and retaining skilled
employe es with the right competences and qualifications.
The bank thus treats working conditions, equal treatment
and opportunity for all employees and protection of their
privacy as material sustainability topics for its own
workforce.
All of the bank’s employees are covered by the reporting
on the bank’s own workforce, including the material
impacts, risks and opportunities.
In terms of material impacts, the bank assesses that all
employees are affected in the same way. The bank’s workforce is consequently not divided into at -risk or
similar groups. Reasons for this are that the bank’s
employees are covered by the local workplace agreement
and have an annual job appraisal review with pay
negotiation. They are also covered by the ban k’s policies
etc. on conditions for employees, equal treatment,
remuneration and data ethics.
The bank registered no cases of material negative
impacts on its own workforce in relation to adequate
wages, collective agreements, equal treatment and
privacy protection in 2024.
In relation to the CSRD requirement on publication of
information on the bank’s non -employees, the bank
defines a non -employee as a person who works for the

Question: Quel est l'écart de rémunération entre les femmes et les hommes au sein de l'entreprise, en tenant compte des données pour l'année de référence ainsi que pour les deux années antérieures, si ces informations ont déjà été publiées dans le passé ?


Context: nan


Answer: L'écart de rémunération entre les femmes et les hommes au sein de l'entreprise, basé sur les données disponibles, est le suivant :

- Pour l'année 2024, l'écart de rémunération moyen entre les sexes est de 24.5 %.
- Les informations spécifiques pour les années 2023 et 2022 ne sont pas fournies dans le contexte donné.
- En ce qui concerne le ratio médian de rémunération entre hommes et femmes à la fin de l'année, il était de 1.23 fois en 2024, 1.25 fois en 2023 et 2022, et 1.26 fois en 2021.

All of the bank’s employees are located in Denmark and

Wages for the bank’s employees
All of the bank’s employees receive adequate wages in
compliance with the applicable standard collective
agreement and workplace agreement.
The bank gives its employees equal pay for the same
work, responsibility, performance etc. The difference in
the average pay for men and women therefore results
from differences in gender representation in different
types of jobs - including management positions.

Actions and targets for adequate wages for own
workforce
The bank wants to pay adequate wages and give equal
pay for the same work, responsibility, performance etc.
Based on the framework of the standard collective
agreement which was entered into between the Danish
Employers’ Association for the Financial Sector and
Financial Services Union Denmark in the first quarter of
2023, the bank’s pay committee has agreed target figures
in the workplace agreement for the bank’s general pay
development in 2023  - 2025.
The workplace agreement covers all employees in the
bank except apprentices, finance trainees, employees
working fewer than eight hours per week and employees
under 18. Employees who are not covered by the
workplace agreement follow the current provisions of the
standard collective agreement.
The bank’s objective is to achieve the defined target
figures for pay development, including general pay
increases, the salary pool and one -off payments. The
target figures will help ensure that the bank pays
adequate wages in line with the market.
The target figures for pay development in 2024 were
achieved. The bank’s HR department has regularly
followed up on achievement of the target figures for pay
development and reported this to the pay committee. The
bank’s general management informs the bank ’s board of
directors annually about achievement of the defined
target figures etc.
Actions and targets for other material impacts on own
workforce
The policy on conditions for employees contributes to
